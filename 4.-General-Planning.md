What do you want to build a component In component Builder You need to come Is a number of things that you need to You need to know what you wanna build You need to know the database structure Set up These are mostly things that you will only know If you have a great Good Understanding Of A table And A database How you Would like to have it No you do not know that I could give you some pointers Needed And at the same time try to Splain Why Ok so We are using Summon distributor That I Develop For Distributing Sermons We using that as our demo Component that How to build So you need to know what you got it So we recorded Then You would need to know The back interviews Now the backend views in Joomla Must be Tightly connected Two Database And possibly In such a way that it Makes sense Database Naming I am not going to be able to To do an extensive Explanation By just By illustrating what Is the best Convention of Obviously component builder will allow you to To break these But later you with Regret doing And gossip We have to read You do a lot of thing The purpose being that Good lot of these convention They are up To implementation Other areas like your crust Ok so We first knew that when we were gonna build Understood That is for fuel Sorry back in views Needed to To be set up Because we wanted these Beaches in Inside of Hulk And that is the sermons I had a List View Of Sermons and Well and Editing View of a And they shared a common data Database And so we had preachers As well Series list And series And they all share and as you can see there they actually Representative Views But one database table That means to Vuze a listview And an edit view and you will hear me repeat these concepts over and over and if I get Confused are please forgive me as just so much repetition that you need to understand that When I talk about views Rural I always talking about the list View If I talk about View Singular I'm always talking about the editable view which is basically in relation to the backend relay Sorry connection of the type database self So you back in usually forms the connection to the database Your front end is much more than they make and that's why we also have a dynamic Get concept which links to site views which is the front of your component these Things will take quite a lot of explanation if you not nude if you sorry if you're new to coding and pH HP and all that JavaScript CSS You possibly get lost but if you're not you'll be very happy in the way with implemented because it leaves With a lot of Dynamics and maneuverability Which is obviously partly why I developed this component because all the others felt Are the component Builders out there felt like a cut like a cookie cutter you know you you can really own Crank out components that are sort of common to each other and I want to build something that's really Dynamic so Barkly for that the site views and the custom backing views are Mostly the same kind of implementation both drawing their data from The Dynamic get Feature in component Builder So you can think of these 23 sorry as working as a team But the back in views stand as the database for these So you need to set up these first and add to them all All the necessary Fields which will then map the database Columns which you can then through the dynamic get connect to so that you can Formulate a data model Which can be reused in your custom backend and in your sight views so I don't know Does that explain it to you let me try again Just to make sure I have everybody on the same page your back interviews are there Tightly connected to database structures so even if you were to look at Proponent order itself You have what is called components And if you were to open one it has fields in it And if you want to go to the database And also open component Builder Component the same table And you to click on structure you would see that the fields That we are seeing Here Your name came Codename version version updates Box Short description Copyright Movies names Are actually mapping directly into the database at licence that it There is name is obviously alphabetical name Codename number images slice Email CSS copyright If it really directly Maps to the database and it is in a way Editing the database through this view So When it comes to the components you're your back in views are all being limited to this Structure And this is not a limitation on component Builders behalf really it's really the way to my love I want you to implement it by doing it this way your class is your model two controllers and Everything else just behave right because of that implementation now I know some might If you know that is a major limitation but that is the Joomla API is implementation and if you Go Beyond that kind of infrastructure you must pop it probably need to look at Way than using component builder because we only implemented it that way so that your Your back interviews directing Maps to the database But because we know that from time to time there is back in views that do not have even there Database but rather takes these already saved information in the database Hydraform other third-party components or even your own component because me know that You would like to take that information and remodel at maybe into a spreadsheet Or into a Table saw table a chart Any other kind of Wait we are a disgusting back in views which behaves on the same Dynamics as The side views which means We trying to give you Best of Both Worlds first being that Strong Paper Kites Typing manage maybe datasets which relates directly to the view and the list View But at the same time the option of adding a custom back in view which can You know you can really do custom scripting in it you need not need to be concerned about all the other Overheads as you would usually be So You first need to know your back into use and then any possible custom views That maybe combines back in view so we could possibly in the future we haven't done so yet Forcibly takes this sticks and sermons And creatures and series is because these sadistic Are taking only the downloads Where us preachers has in them a field called hits And so does sermons have a field called hits that's just when someone opens one Without downloading is necessarily so the series is But sadistic sonly count the downloads of sermons so we could possibly add an extra Back in field sweet view custom back in Called Analysis Pointing And Then in analysis we can use the dynamic get Option To get data from Old Widow stables These tables basically from marijuana And Richard table And a series table It's so short and it a little That Handsome And then from them Do what we would call model Modelling Modelling the data And possibly end up with A whole new Data structure which we can then Place into a table or into a Chart In that view which means that it is now dynamic And no longer directly connected To the Database As these above Views are And it won't won't really have an edit view it will be a Single View Just displaying rows An analysis data From does multiple back in Database Tables And this Can also be done on the front of the site So That means this whole Get Feature We could Take it Put it under get And we can give it a name and we can call it It is the analysis Get Get analysis We could call it that And then the analysis will basically get used the cat analysis To get the data And then Takes that data and model setting Sorry Displays it Page And the same can be done To the front So the same Dynamic get can we use them The front again So that's sort of how component builder works If you not looking at the fields itself The fields is a discussion on its own but This which I have now sort of just typed out your very basic and aliment Is really what you need to know before coming to component Builder You need to know what you want to achieve What do you want to Build Ants If possible map the field Under each of these So in sermons we will have name And We will have Preacher Right And we'll have series And we will have Files Right So they should be under Sermons that on the preacher We will have also name And we will have Maybe email Scripture Website Oh maybe I can't I can't hear Same goes for series We will add a name And I think I will be Description Since we only counting downloads we will have a Farming And We will have a counter And we will have a sermon Which is the ID Just leave it this So now And That will be it So That means if you can Somehow Map these things Before hand it will help you tremendously The reason being That If you start in component Builder You can Start by creating A new component And you can add name and all this information But then you'd get to obviously you would skip most of these for the initially just getting started You just set up these Fields that are compulsory Stars And This component image that tells you here Dimensions 300-360 And you must put it in the image folder And then you can access it from here Let me see This version updates Is there Nice feature which will really look into detail later So you at all these compulsory fields At settings You would hardly do anything Scripts as well you just leave blank read me also playing Then add views After you've saved the component once I mean That means you've Now added name and you've added these and you clicked save Then You'd basically be able to start adding views to it Now the way to add a view to component Is different from the way to create a view You adding to view through the settings tab But you can create new views through this area and you can also see you're ready connected Explain this again some PB this is gonna be the duplication What are you really primarily wanted to show you Is that if you start building a component You feel very lost if you do not know where you going And This will help you know where you going it will help you know it you need to set up these views And you need to add these Fields to those views And That that kind of information and knowing how to construct this is something that you Need to know before hand No obviously you can always add more fields And you can always get more views it's not that you need to be that far and be That sure that you didn't miss Missed something It's more that you just need to know what you wanna do I cannot decide that for you And you need to realise it you literally have to create all of these Fields before you can add them Into a view and this Line Are seen as a view although it When it's compiled will represent two views It is in component builders Component Back and views It's in as one of you And is Fields will need to be created before they can be added to this view in the same goes with these The nice thing though is the name field Can You can create it once and use it reuse it 3 times So you can reuse the name fuel You can also ring the use the head swell Sorry the heat sorry Are already at it By Default so you don't need to add an it's field We'll be talking about the default Fields later In showing you which Fields you don't need to add Yourself but he's at dynamic To each back in View A back in View now This is also a back in view but I'm I would always mention that there is a custom back in View The purpose being that it doesn't directly relate to a single Database What gives you the option of pulling from multiple databases as I've explained here And modelling the data and then displaying in So that's sort of a quick overview of how to get started with a component I realise there's so much more to say but it's very difficult to cover all of that and Hopefully as we go along Whatever questions still remain Will be answered We will be starting At fields So it seems sort of turned around right You I feel we must start at the core Ponant and then build views And then build the fields and you possibly right And you can do that I mean you can after having created the component You can click your own admin views which is the first Things you need to create is the app that views And click new and create an admin view but again even there You just like with the component only be able to set the bare bone information and not all the knee Need it more Nitty gritty complex information if I could say it so And that's why I usually Sorry I usually start at the bottom the bottom and work my way up I only start with creating all the fields I know I'm gonna need so I will basically Collapse this take these away Like that And Just go create all these fields And when I see there are duplicate Fields I would remove them Because I know we use them So I'll just create Fields that I know are unique And then when I come to certain Fields Like These These are custom fields These I won't 38 initially These are the custom fields These are custom fields And I won't create them initially So I would also separate the custom field now how do I know it's a custom field Spell because the preacher Is a I wanted to pull ideas from the preacher view so if we glad to hear Ok let's Marcus custom Fields again I would like to have This field basically link to that name write a list of these names And the same for the series I would like it to link to that value And In July you can create what is known as custom fields And component bowl that makes provision for you to do so But this is what I would call an advanced field And so we will only look at advanced custom fields After we've looked at creating Normal fields And grating Actually back in views Because only then will you understand the implementation of this custom Field since it will be linking to a buck in views value It's it's not just linking to a bunch of values if Linking directly To this back in views value called name and so we can't really create it until we re Really know how this is gonna look and that's why we will be only looking at that after I possibly Explain this again but Just that we Let you know where we going Building a component needs these kind of things Sort through and sort of mapped out Some of us might not need to write it down some of us do depends on who you are To me that doesn't really matter even if you have these things in your head As long as you come to component order knowing exactly well sorry that's At least knowing partially what you want to achieve and what you want Build Now that means you can do a lot of paper Planning and do do a lot of sort of structuring Of your component long before actually getting to component builder itself And that's really what this Short Tutorial was trying to illustrate That if you haven't done this you might get lost and not know where you heading when you start mapping The Fields and it be used in Things in component build itself Well thank you for watching Next stop Start looking at Field types And then we'll look at using fuel types Great fields And so solely will be perfect Progressing to eventually ending up with having this component Fully functional and working And we will be illustrating all of these Fields as they relate to this backend views that Linked Database tables And Hopefully that will give you A good enough in insight and Standing How old is she Ok thank you for watching
