## Introduction - How To Build a Component

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)

In this tutorial, we begin at the **Joomla Component Builder (JCB) Dashboard** inside the Joomla backend. The goal is to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of JCB, followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to build your own Joomla component from scratch.

Joomla Component Builder allows developers to create, manage, and compile complex Joomla components entirely from within the Joomla interface. It provides an environment where multiple components can coexist, share views, and use the same infrastructure.

The instructor introduces several components already built with JCB, including multiple versions of the Component Builder itself - all maintained within a single instance of JCB.

> **Tip:** You can easily create different versions of your component for clients by **duplicating** a component in JCB and making specific adjustments to the copy. This allows rapid version management and streamlined development.

## JCB Is Fully Open Source

Joomla Component Builder is a single, unified project released under the GNU GPL. There is **no hidden “pro” edition** and no paid upgrade that unlocks additional capabilities. All advanced tooling, helper scripts, plugins, and demo material ship in the public package you download. The community decided to make the entire feature set openly available so that everyone can study, use, and improve JCB without encountering a pay gate. When you install the extension, you receive the complete toolchain that previously powered the closed “pro” release.

## Using the Compiler

[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m55s)

The **Compiler** is the heart of JCB. It transforms all the database settings, configurations, and code templates into a ready-to-install Joomla component.

1. Select the component you wish to compile (in this example, the Component Builder package itself is chosen).
2. Click **Compile** to begin.
3. JCB runs its internal scripts, taking data from the database and generating complete code for your component.
   [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m14s)

Once the compilation completes, JCB provides statistics on:

* The number of lines written
* Estimated development time saved
* The ability to **install**, **download**, or **copy the installation URL**

[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m18s)

If you're developing online, you can use the provided link to install the component directly into another Joomla site. In an offline environment, you'll download and manually install it.

## Clear Your Temporary Folder

[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m37s)

After compiling and downloading a component, it's **crucial to clear your Joomla temporary folder**.

If left uncleared, your compiled component's `.zip` file remains accessible in the `/tmp` folder of your site. This can pose a **security risk**, as anyone who can access that file path may download your private component package.

> **Important:** Always delete compiled `.zip` files from the temporary folder to ensure your work remains private and secure.
> *This is especially important when developing commercial or client-specific extensions.*

[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m22s)

## Setting Up a Blank Test Website

[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m47s)

To test your component, it's best practice to install it on a **fresh Joomla installation**. This ensures that all tables and configuration data are created cleanly without interference from previous builds.

1. Go to your **test Joomla site**.
2. Use the installation link or upload the `.zip` package generated by JCB.
3. Click **Install**.
   Once the installation completes, Joomla will display a success message confirming that your component is installed.

## Understanding the Included Sample Data

[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m19s)

JCB ships with the full collection of field types, demo components, and configuration examples that were historically bundled with the closed editions. These reference items live inside the package’s SQL files so that every installation starts with the same rich dataset. If you ever experiment with the data and want to compare it to the defaults, the following sections explain how to inspect and restore those records.

## Accessing Database Information in Your Component

[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m49s)

1. Locate your compiled `.zip` file in your file system.
2. Extract it and navigate to the `admin/sql/` directory.
   [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m02s)
3. Open the `install.sql` file. This file defines the database tables for your component.
4. Scroll to the bottom of this file to view **dumped data entries**.
   [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s)

The installer now includes the complete dataset by default. You will find numerous predefined field types, help menus, and demo records ready to explore or adapt for your own projects.

## Option 1: Reinstall JCB to Restore Default Data

[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m05s)

If you want to reset JCB to the original dataset, perform a clean reinstall:

1. Go to **Extensions → Manage → Manage**.
2. Select your existing Component Builder installation.
3. Click **Uninstall**.
4. Install the current public package you downloaded.

> Joomla only creates tables during a **fresh installation**, not on updates.
> Therefore, uninstalling ensures the default data is restored exactly as shipped.

[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m29s)

## Option 2: Restore Sample Data Manually via MySQL

[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m41s)

Advanced users can manually import database content:

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** or another MySQL management tool.
2. Locate the relevant JCB tables (e.g., `#__fieldtypes`).
3. **Truncate** the table to clear old data.
   [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m30s)
4. Copy the SQL dump data from the package's `install.sql` file.
5. Replace the table prefix (`#__`) with your actual Joomla table prefix.
6. Paste and execute the SQL query.
   [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m49s)

This will update your JCB tables with the default dataset—without reinstalling the entire component. However, this approach requires SQL knowledge and careful handling.

[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m29s)

## Reinstalling JCB After a Reset

[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m53s)

After a clean reinstall from **VDM.IO**, you'll start with a clean slate:

* No old component data remains.
* Only the updated field types and structures are installed.

After installation, navigate to **Components → Component Builder** in the backend.
[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m20s)

You'll see an empty component list but with a full set of **enhanced field types** available for future projects.

## Exploring the Included Field Types

[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m15s)

With the public package installed:

* Navigate to **Field Types** inside Component Builder.
* Notice a larger selection of predefined field types.
* Some demo fields and configurations are also included.
  [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m44s)

This version provides an excellent foundation to begin building complex Joomla components.
The tutorial will continue by exploring **Field Types** in detail as the next step in your JCB journey.
