# Joomla Component Builder - Dynamic File and Folder Inclusion

### Tutorial Reference

**Video:** "Dynamic File and Folder Inclusion Concept"

## 1. Introduction to Dynamic Inclusion

**[00:00:00 → 00:01:17]**

Joomla Component Builder introduces a **dynamic file and folder inclusion system** that allows developers to include external files or folders-either local or remote-directly into their component package.

This feature enhances automation and flexibility when developing complex Joomla components that rely on shared or external resources.

### Key Concept

You can now:

* Include **external files or folders** (even from outside the Joomla root directory).
* Fetch and embed **remote files** (such as from GitHub or another website) directly into your component.
* Manage code snippets dynamically with **EXTERNALCODE**.

---

## 2. Accessing the Advanced Tab for Dynamic Files

**[00:02:03 → 00:02:35]**

Navigate to the **"Files & Folders"** area within JCB.
A new **"Advanced" tab** has been added to complement the existing **Basic tab**.

### What It Does

* Allows JCB to **grab files from anywhere in your system** and add them to your component package.
* Supports **files outside the Joomla root directory**, provided PHP has the necessary read permissions.

> **Tip:** Normally, you'll only need files inside your Joomla component directory.
> Use external inclusion only when your workflow specifically requires external dependencies.

---

## 3. Adding Files and Folders

**[00:02:53 → 00:04:21]**

You can configure JCB to package non-generated custom files or folders along with your component. This means you can keep such files where they belong during development and have JCB include them automatically during compilation.

### Path Settings

* **Use constants** in file paths (e.g., `_VDM_PATH_`).
* Do **not** wrap constants in quotes.
* JCB's compiler automatically interprets these constants correctly.

Example (inside JCB):

```
VDM_PATH.'/libraries/vdm_io'
```

Becomes dynamically resolved by the compiler without additional syntax.

## 4. Defining the Target Path and ZIP Relation

**[00:04:29 → 00:05:39]**

When setting up file or folder inclusion:

1. **Define the target path** within your component's ZIP structure.
   Example: `libraries/vdm_io`
2. This allows JCB to include non-standard folders (like libraries) into the component package.
3. On installation, these folders are automatically copied into their proper places.

> **Example Use Case:**
> Include Composer-managed library files directly into your JCB component without separate packaging.

---

## 5. Automatic Installation Scripts for Non-Standard Folders

**[00:05:53 → 00:07:59]**

If JCB detects that your target path is **outside** the usual Admin, Media, or Site directories, it adds a special installer script function (`setDynamicF0ld3rs`) to handle those folders correctly.

### Script Behavior

* Moves specified folders to the right destination during installation or updates.
* Ignores Admin, Media, and Site folders (these are handled natively by Joomla).
* Handles all other locations dynamically.

> **Warning:**
> This feature is powerful but potentially dangerous.
> You could unintentionally overwrite files anywhere in the Joomla installation.
> **Use with caution** and only when you control the deployment environment.

---

## 6. Security Reminder

**[00:09:13]**

Be mindful when importing JCB packages created by others.

> **Note:**
> Dynamic inclusion can theoretically move files anywhere on your system.
> Only import and install JCB packages from **trusted developers**.

---

## 7. Using `EXTERNALCODE` Snippets

**[00:09:49 → 00:12:38]**

The `EXTERNALCODE` keyword allows JCB to dynamically fetch and embed **external code snippets** into your component at compile time.

### How It Works

* Can reference **local file paths** or **remote URLs** (e.g., GitHub raw file links).
* Useful for including code shared in Git repositories or team snippets.
* JCB automatically creates and tracks a **hash signature** of the code for change detection.

#### Example:

```
EXTERNALCODE:https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/raw/fancydate.txt
```

This snippet fetches the raw file contents and embeds it into your component helper or class area.

> **Note:**
> Currently, EXTERNALCODE does **not support constants** in paths-use absolute paths or full URLs.

---

## 8. Compilation and Hash Validation

**[00:13:19 → 00:15:11]**

When compiling a component with EXTERNALCODE:

* JCB fetches the external resource.
* It displays a **message confirming** that external code has been added.
* A **hash** is generated to monitor for changes in future compilations.

If the snippet changes:

* JCB shows a **warning** under "Warnings" after recompilation.
* You are prompted to verify that the code change is legitimate.

---

## 9. Post-Compilation Validation

**[00:16:16 → 00:18:49]**

After compilation:

1. Check that the included external code appears correctly in your component files (e.g., within the `helpers` directory).
2. If a change is detected in a later compilation, review the updated code for security and correctness.
3. Confirm that any modifications are expected (e.g., from your GitHub source).

---

## 10. Handling External Code Updates Safely

**[00:17:20 → 00:19:16]**

If an external snippet changes:

* JCB will automatically notify you during compilation.
* Check the affected file to confirm that only expected updates were made.
* JCB also ensures any injected malicious code is escaped as a string, preventing direct execution.

> **Best Practice:**
> Always verify the **hash change message** after every compilation involving external snippets.

---

## 11. Final Thoughts

**[00:20:15 → 00:20:54]**

The **Dynamic File and Folder Inclusion** and **EXTERNALCODE** features are advanced tools designed for professional Joomla developers who want:

* Modular, reusable codebases.
* Automated inclusion of shared libraries or scripts.
* A robust way to collaborate via GitHub while maintaining component integrity.

However, with great flexibility comes great responsibility:

* Always validate source integrity.
* Only share JCB packages with trusted collaborators.
* Keep inclusion paths and permissions tightly controlled.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dynamic File Inclusion**   | Add external or internal files into your component.           | Medium     | When including static libraries or helper files. |
| **Dynamic Folder Inclusion** | Move external folders into Joomla directories during install. | High       | Use only if fully aware of file paths.           |
| **EXTERNALCODE**             | Fetch external code snippets from GitHub or URLs.             | Medium     | Ideal for version-controlled helper functions.   |
| **Compiler Hash Checking**   | Detects unauthorized or unexpected changes.                   | Low        | Always review warning messages.                  |

## Helpful Tips

* Use **JCB constants** for dynamic paths to ensure portability across environments.
* Keep external inclusions **version-controlled** via GitHub.
* Periodically **recompile and verify hashes** to maintain component integrity.
* Never use EXTERNALCODE from unverified or public sources.
