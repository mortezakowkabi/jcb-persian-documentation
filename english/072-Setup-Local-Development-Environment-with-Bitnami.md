## 1. Introduction to Bitnami

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h00m00s)

Bitnami is a trusted **distributor of pre-packaged software images** that include everything you need to run applications locally or in the cloud.
They partner with major providers like **Amazon Web Services**, and offer ready-to-use stacks for Joomla.

### Why Bitnami?

* It bundles **Apache**, **MySQL**, **PHP**, and **Joomla** in a single installable package.
* It creates an isolated development environment - **no interference** with your system's existing PHP or MySQL setup.
* It's available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
* It includes **phpMyAdmin** by default.
* It supports **quick uninstallation** and **clean removal** when done testing.

> **Tip:** Command-line familiarity is helpful but not mandatory. Bitnami provides a guided graphical installer for most systems.

## 2. Installing the Bitnami Joomla Stack

### Step 1: Download Bitnami Joomla Stack

1. Search for **"Bitnami Joomla Stack"** in your browser.
2. Visit the official Bitnami site or Joomla's documentation link.
3. Choose the correct installer for your system:

   * **Windows** (`.exe`)
   * **macOS** (`.dmg`)
   * **Linux** (`.run`)

[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h01m13s)

Bitnami provides simple setup tutorials that guide you through selecting the installation directory, user credentials, and MySQL configuration.

## 3. Download and Run the Installer

[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h02m54s)

### Windows/macOS

* Download the **`.exe`** or **`.dmg`** file.
* Double-click the installer.
* Follow the prompts in the setup wizard.

### Linux

Linux users need to make the installer executable before running it.

```bash
# Make the file executable
sudo chmod +x bitnami-joomla-<version>.run

# Run the installer
./bitnami-joomla-<version>.run
```

[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h04m23s)

When prompted:

* Choose your installation directory (e.g. `/home/<username>/joomla_bitnami`)
* Enter a password for the Joomla Administrator.
* Accept default MySQL port (`3307` if `3306` is already in use).
* Skip Bitnami Cloud setup (optional).

---

## 4. Installation Process Overview

[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h06m20s)

Bitnami now installs and configures:

* **Apache**
* **PHP**
* **MySQL**
* **Joomla** (with its own database)

[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h06m58s)

The installer isolates everything in one directory (e.g., `joomla_bitnami`) - making it safe to test without affecting existing environments.

Once complete, click **Finish** and **Launch Bitnami Joomla Stack**.

## 5. Access Joomla and Install JCB

[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h08m10s)

### Step 1: Access Joomla

* Open your browser and go to:

  ```
  http://localhost/joomla
  ```
* Log in using the username and password you set during installation.

### Step 2: Install Joomla Component Builder (JCB)

* Go to **Extensions → Manage → Install**.
* Search for **"JCB"** in the Joomla Extensions Directory.
* Click **Install**.

[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h09m00s)

> **Note:** The JCB installer retrieves the latest **master branch** directly from GitHub.

---

## 6. Import JCB Demo Packages

[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h09m13s)

After installing JCB:

1. Open **Component → JCB**.
2. Go to **Install JCB Packages**.
3. Choose **VDM Packages** or **JCB Community Packages**.
4. Select **Hello World** → click **Get Package**.

The package is downloaded and validated automatically.
Once imported, compile and install the **Hello World** component.

---

## 7. Testing the Hello World Component

[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h10m40s)

1. Open **Components → Hello World → Greetings**.
2. Add a new greeting and save it.
3. Go to the **Frontend** (Main Menu → Hello World).
4. If permissions are restricted, enable:

   * `Site` → `Greetings` → **Public: Allowed**

[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h11m14s)

Return to the frontend and confirm the text displays correctly.
You now have a fully working **Hello World** Joomla component on your Bitnami stack - all within minutes.

## 8. Exploring the Bitnami Directory Structure

[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h12m17s)

To locate your Joomla files:

```
joomla_bitnami/
│
├── apache2/
├── mysql/
└── apps/
    └── joomla/
        └── htdocs/
```

Inside **`htdocs`** you'll find the entire Joomla website - including your installed components.
You can edit and test your JCB-generated files directly here.

> **Tip:** This structure allows you to quickly modify PHP, view templates, and test compiled components in real time.

---

## 9. phpMyAdmin Integration

[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h12m40s)

Bitnami includes **phpMyAdmin** out of the box.
Access it via:

```
http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```

Use this to inspect and manage your Joomla databases easily.

---

## 10. Managing and Uninstalling Bitnami

[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h13m39s)

In your Bitnami folder, you'll find:

* **Manager Tool** → start/stop servers
* **Uninstall script** → cleanly remove the stack

To uninstall:

1. Run the uninstaller executable.
2. Confirm "Yes" when prompted.
3. Wait while it removes all related files.

[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&t=00h14m28s)

> **Warning:** Uninstallation removes **everything**, including Joomla, JCB, and databases.
> Always **export your JCB packages** before uninstalling.
