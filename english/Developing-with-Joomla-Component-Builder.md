# Developing with Joomla Component Builder

This page explains how the written and video resources for Joomla Component Builder (JCB) work together. The original text was a loose transcript about documenting the tutorial series; the rewritten version gives you a concise guide you can follow when planning your own study routine.

## Why these transcripts exist

The video lessons listed on the [Home](./index.md) page are being transcribed so that every spoken instruction is available as searchable text. Each chapter will eventually include:

- Verbatim dialogue that clarifies terminology used in the videos.
- Screenshots taken from the lesson with direct links to the moment they appear on YouTube.
- Contextual links to documentation or companion tools mentioned in the recording.

As a result, you can learn visually, read along, or quickly check a topic without replaying an entire video.

## Tips for studying effectively

- **Track your progress:** copy the timeline markers from the documentation into your own notes. When you return to a chapter you can jump straight to the minute you left off.
- **Annotate while you learn:** add reminders or TODOs next to concepts you need to revisit. The structured Markdown makes it easy to paste sections into your favourite editor.
- **Switch modalities:** pause the video, review the written steps, and then resume playback. Alternating between formats reinforces understanding.

## Companion manual (forthcoming)

A Microsoft Word edition of the manual is in development. It will mirror the wiki but apply richer formatting so you can read offline or print excerpts. If you prefer open-source tooling, [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) can open the document without issue.
