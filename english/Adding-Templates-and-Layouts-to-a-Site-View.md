After adding a **Dynamic Get** to a Site View, it's essential to understand how **templates** and **layouts** integrate with these views. Templates act as the high-level wrappers that orchestrate HTML, PHP, reusable layouts, and any custom code placeholders or frontend libraries you attach to the view. This section shows you where each piece of code resides, how Joomla loads it, and how JCB structures them during component compilation.

> **New to JCB Templates?** Think of them as modular view structures that can include other templates, call layouts, and even be synced from shared repositories. Mastering how they wrap your view logic will make the rest of this tutorial much easier to follow.

## **1. Exploring Templates in a Site View**

### Example: *Preacher View*

[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h00m33s)

In the **Sermon Distributor** example (`/components/com_sermondistributor/views/preacher/tmpl/`), you will find multiple PHP files, such as:

```
default.php
default_preacherbox.php
default_preacherpanel.php
default_preachersmall.php
```

[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h00m58s)

Each of these is a **template**, and they are recognized as such because of how they are included within the default file.

---

### **The Default File - The Site View Core**

[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h01m18s)

The `default.php` file is the main file for the site view - essentially **the view's entry point**.
Inside this file, templates are loaded and rendered.
When you open the **Site View editor in JCB**, the code shown there corresponds directly to the contents of this default file.

---

### **Locating Template Snippets in JCB**

[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h01m50s)

At the bottom of a Site View in JCB, you'll find the **template snippet calls**, such as:

```php
$this->loadTemplate('preacherpanel');
```

[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h02m19s)

You may see template options like:

```
preacher, grid, list, table, panel, box, small
```

These snippets reference the associated template files that JCB compiles into your component.

---

### **Switching Between PHP and HTML in Templates**

[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h02m37s)

Templates can mix PHP and HTML. For example:

```php
<?php if ($this->preacher) : ?>
    <div class="uk-card uk-card-default">
        <?php echo $this->preacher->name; ?>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h03m04s)

This structure allows you to alternate between PHP and HTML blocks as needed for clean UI design and logic separation.

---

## **2. How JCB Integrates Templates into Site Views**

[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h03m31s)

Inside the compiled component, open `default.php` to confirm template inclusion.
You'll notice the same PHP-to-HTML transitions reflected in the generated code.

[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h04m22s)

Templates have access to all **global fields and class methods** available in the default view.
For instance, both can access:

```php
$this->preacher;
$this->params;
```

[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h05m07s)

When you place a snippet like `$this->loadTemplate('preacherpanel');` into the Site View code, JCB automatically links it to the corresponding template file under `tmpl/`.
That's how **templates become part of the Site View** during compilation.

## **3. Working With Layouts**

### **Quick Layout Example**

[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h05m52s)

Layouts are used differently from templates. While templates structure a single view's display, **layouts** are reusable display parts that can be shared across multiple templates or views.

[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h06m53s)

In Joomla conventions:

* **Templates** can include other **templates**,
* **Layouts** can include other **layouts**,
* But templates cannot include layouts directly.

[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h07m44s)

These rules stem from how Joomla implements rendering, not limitations in JCB.

---

### **Passing Data into Layouts**

[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h08m02s)

Layouts do not automatically have access to the same `$this` scope as templates.
You must **pass variables manually** when rendering them:

```php
echo JLayoutHelper::render('my_layout', ['items' => $this->items]);
```

This allows precise control over what data each layout receives.

[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h08m53s)

Within JCB, when creating a layout, you can choose which **Dynamic Get dataset** is available. However, the layout itself won't affect the Site View's data model-it's purely for display.

---

### **Adding Layouts to the Component**

[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h09m51s)

When you include a layout snippet (for example, in the default Site View), JCB ensures the corresponding layout file is created in your component's `/layouts/` directory.
This allows that layout to be reused in other templates and views as needed.

[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h10m19s)

> **Tip:** Layouts and templates function identically in **Custom Admin Views** within JCB.
> Both rely on snippets to include and render content modularly.

## **4. Summary of Template and Layout Integration**

[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBbi3Rl2eY&t=00h11m10s)

By combining templates and layouts effectively:

* You keep code modular and maintainable.
* You can reuse common structures across multiple views.
* Component Builder automates their linking via snippets during compilation.

**Templates** form the visual skeleton of each view.
**Layouts** let you organize smaller code blocks for repeated use across your component.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* Templates reside in the `tmpl/` folder of each view and are added using `$this->loadTemplate('name');`.
* Layouts are shared code pieces stored in `/layouts/`, added using `JLayoutHelper::render()`.
* Templates have access to `$this` and all global view properties.
* Layouts require explicit variable passing.
* Joomla's conventions govern how templates and layouts can be nested.
* The **Templates** tab in JCB lets you import, reset, or push these wrappers from template repositories so teams stay in sync.

When a shared Site View evolves, select it in JCB and choose **Reset** to sync the template, layout, and library references with the maintained version before recompiling. If your team needs a divergent long-term experience, fork the template repository, point JCB to your fork, and keep your custom code placeholders version-controlled alongside your layouts.
