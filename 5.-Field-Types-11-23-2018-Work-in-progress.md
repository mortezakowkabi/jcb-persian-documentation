If you have a good understanding of the Joomla! API you'll know it can build forms that can be used in a component; it's done using an XML file. Joomla! Component Builder builds the XML file and places it in a location a model, view and controller can access using the Joomla! API. JCB builds the fields which you define in a view containing the fields displayed by the component. These and other terms will be defined as we proceed. Let's start start with field types, then list and edit views using Joomla! articles.

A field type is needed if you are building a field. Use of views, field types, and fields can be seen when you create a Joomla! article. When you do the first thing you see is the view. Scroll down and you'll see a URL displaying View = article indicating this is the article view.

If you close this article view you'll see a list of articles created in the web site. You won't see any articles here if it's a blank website. The list of articles is also called a view. If you click on an row in the list you will see the edit or single view. Your components will usually have these two views in the admin area to list and edit your different data sets. Let's take a look at the views and the fields they display.

### All Fields Live In Views
The Joonla! article title is a text field type; the alias is also a text field type. The editor block is a text editor field. There are others like list, radio, tag, text, date, user, text-area, label. You will see JCB has placed all these in the component for you. You can make use of each of these different types by applying one to a field. All fields live in views which is an important concept to understand. Now, you might not think that a list view has fields and you are partly right. It does do more than just display these fields. Let's create a test article here to show what we mean.

### Joomla! Articles List and Article Edit Views
After adding some content, save and close the article so we at least have a list item. That is also a field and if you click on search all those options are fields. So, your list has certain fields which are only available in the list view. This is also the place where we do most of our features for multiple items where opening one item does what's only required for one item. There is a table which is part of the list that Component Builder sets Up. The bucket list and edit views are built for you, based on the fields and input value mapped to them in your view. We will look at these other concepts more deeply but I need to have you understand from which angle we are coming. We will try and show you that inside of this article you will be creating fields, even put them into different tabs, which will have been rendered in a specific order by the Joomla! component after it's been compiled using Component Builder. That's using Joomla!'s Article Manager as sort of an example.

We could just as well go into Component Builder Since it has the demo application. See a detailed explanation of the demo component and building a local developer environment to run it. After selecting the demo Compile, it displays a warning because we haven't set some options in the global settings. It doesn't mean that there's been an error in the compiling. It just means it couldn't move the file to the git repository. If we deselect some compile options and start again it doesn't give you the same warning. Click install and compiled component gets installed Into this Joomla site. It doesn't have any images because that we don't ship the images with the components. It's easy to use your own.  

### Joomla! Component Builder Demo Component
If you click on add a Look It will open the edit and it keeps you on the Look. It also opens a list view where the list of Looks will be displayed. We added an import feature which your normal Joomla! components don't have. We will explain that later. If it's new you can add text to your radio button. If I add something to the text field it opens an alias which is also a text field. We also have a repeatable field and we can add information to it. That is a look at the features in the demo component. The + [appendix](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/wiki/Using-the-JCB-Demo-Component-While-Building-Your-Local-Development-System) has a detailed description of the demo component along with step by step instructions on building a local development environment to run it on.

Now let's look at how fields get into the component and use the Joomla! infrastructure. If we go to Admin views and select Look Open look you'll find the fields we just looked at. The name is used to map the field into the view using the field here. Reason why you cannot add using this area is because this is to edit existing fields. Instead of adding them. So, if you were to open a admin view you can edit them from here especially if you Have many components and many fields. This is a way to Sort of just look at the fields related to this components. If you were to add more Fields you would open this box and this is where you'll be adding them. Let's get back to field types because that's really where it all starts. We've already added all the field types to JCB that I think you will need.

The field types are mapped into the libraries inside of Joomla! Joomla! has many field types and for each field type which you build you need to set certain values in an XML document. These values in our free samples use a checkbox Set Up in Properties. So, you have to be certain when changing properties that you adjust the corresponding field. This applies only to the checkbox field. Most of the time you would never need to do that. An exception is adding more field types which we haven't covered, or if you want to extend the existing field types. For the most part you should not tinker with field types. I hope this explains where the field type comes from and the amazing scale produced from its use.

With most other Component Builders you need to wait for the developer to add a new field type. With Component Builder you can add your own field type which requires mapping it to the Joomla! library. Joomla! has their field type set to certain types now such as a repeatable field which is quite tricky and needs special attention even in the code of the JCB compiler. But the majority of field types are very straight forward and simple to implement. So, we have created  tutorials to help you with the learning process.

We have not implemented all the attributes that can be targeted though. You might need to add them if you want to use them. For example, I added this show on Action While recently to all field types which I did ti show and hide fields based on other fields values. An application was replaced in Joomla! Component Builder to take control of the features to show and hide fields. This is an added feature which you might use yourself and add to your component. If you are developing a feature we can add to a Component Builder version I would obviously suggest to do that I would still explain much more on this topic as we continue. Getting back to field types I continue.

There is a name which is called type And a value for checkbox and it must be set to not adjustable because that is the way it is expected. If you don't understand any of this information that I'm showing you here Then a place to go to is to open the form fields and you'll see a whole list of form fields. These are the same for all Fields you just saw in our component. If I was to take the checkbox Up Your list of checkboxes and open that you'd see that they give you a list of those fields. Next type name and JCB tells you what is mandatory and what is optional and basically we are just mapping that data into this here. If we want to add another attribute, click on the + and it creates a new field and we add the name at the value sweet peace which is in correspondence And some information This is really for yourself this information block here We put information there when later when you use this field type you are reminded what this specific at Rip And I I basically took this information Why Copying it right here from To my last website and placed it in there And where I felt there might be more said I added some customs text to it And what these values will do is it'll create an XML string like that In your form Which Joomla then uses to build those forms So Basically we first setup a fuel Type by Telling you Which input Values would be able to use for the specific field type which is the status Checkboxes And then we save this And then later you can reuse this fuel type when you start creating fields So let me just close this check box And go to text field And you'll see that you're is a List of the fields That used text field as its type Now you can open one of these fields And you're the bottom you see very something very similar if I was to go back here And go to text field Humorous website

You see that it shows you examples of how that XML line should look right see Now Yeah In the Field area where you created to field Basically gave the few the name this is just for the system The name used here is the one that is important That should be the correct name the label This name is just that you when you add it to your view You know this is what we used to identify it Weston explain adding it to the view In more detail This diet data type and things were also explain we only go into more depth around What a field is and how to build one I'm simply now looking at few pipes and showing you how the changes that you've made in field type Effects I feel that you would build with that type So here is that Detail that was in field type Member on change And it tells you What is mandatory in what is optional but that's basically because I placed it in the description right I mean let's be country close to go back to that field type And then take on property And we'll see that I added optional and mandatory To the description So that I can know is this option or mandatory Yes you could Possibly argued that I should have done it from here and that it's not true don't be necessary to add it there But you know this is that this The settings here is used when we compile the component Where is this Here is used for you You know what this field attribute is all about And maybe as weak Continue to develop this component I might Make it changed to that But I wouldn't make such a change that it affects anything that already exists Dramatically and anyway Ok so let's go back to a field

The way the compiler works it is doesn't really grab the string and just put it into the XML In fact if I show you how a string looks that the compiler is built Wrong window Let's go to the string that the compiler is built Assessment type You see that it is completely reformatted The label is turned into a translatable string So it's been done done with the description It also tells you where in the compiler if well we'll still look at that because this might Sometimes show and sometimes you can Tweak Your Your component that it doesn't show it But it tells you Europe in which line in the Compiler it was built and also in which file which is very nice I think those of you that are developers will appreciate this feature from tremendously I also tells you the fuel type so Obviously as you can see it as we scroll through this You can see that Component builder really goes way out of its way to Reconstruct That That field It is not using This directly It in fact Grabs That area And that To determine that this is a Text Field So it actually is really dependent on that part Which is up dude name come now And That part there So the opening Exclamation and the closing one And the value in between those is what is used So if you prefer by accident drop off this Or that it will still work perfectly

These are really the only Things that are Really need it And part of what I am Hoping to achieve eventually is that this becomes just input Fields Like These And yet I'm wondering if I should go that way The fact that they all in one big text area Leaves us with a lot of room and freedom 2/2 really adjusted easily without major Complications And any case if you start a new field which we'll look at later It populates this with the demo demo data and the demo data Is actually values that you said When you create a fuel type You see Here it is the demo is this Value or example That is placed here It's from these values that region is in if you create a new text field It grabs these values as the values which you can then Adjust to your purpose Of you you know Implementation for that specific field at that moment If you leave it blank it will also build it without any value Between those two Estimation marks Ok That is looking at fuel types 

Most field types have been set up for you and you hardly ever would need to come here except fro a deeper understanding of how filed types work and how Joomla! and JCB implement them. You do not need to change things unless you wish to. You may be interested in my next tutorial on how to use field types in fields.
