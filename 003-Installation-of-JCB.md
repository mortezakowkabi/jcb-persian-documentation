## Introduction - How To Build a Component

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)

In this tutorial, we begin at the **Joomla Component Builder (JCB) Dashboard** inside the Joomla backend. The goal is to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of JCB, followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to build your own Joomla component from scratch.

Joomla Component Builder allows developers to create, manage, and compile complex Joomla components entirely from within the Joomla interface. It provides an environment where multiple components can coexist, share views, and use the same infrastructure.

The instructor introduces several components already built with JCB, including multiple versions of the Component Builder itself - all maintained within a single instance of JCB.

> **Tip:** You can easily create different versions of your component for clients by **duplicating** a component in JCB and making specific adjustments to the copy. This allows rapid version management and streamlined development.

## Using the Compiler

[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m55s)

The **Compiler** is the heart of JCB. It transforms all the database settings, configurations, and code templates into a ready-to-install Joomla component.

1. Select the component you wish to compile (in this example, the *public* version is chosen).
2. Click **Compile** to begin.
3. JCB runs its internal scripts, taking data from the database and generating complete code for your component.
   [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m14s)

Once the compilation completes, JCB provides statistics on:

* The number of lines written
* Estimated development time saved
* The ability to **install**, **download**, or **copy the installation URL**

[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m18s)

If you're developing online, you can use the provided link to install the component directly into another Joomla site. In an offline environment, you'll download and manually install it.

## Clear Your Temporary Folder

[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m37s)

After compiling and downloading a component, it's **crucial to clear your Joomla temporary folder**.

If left uncleared, your compiled component's `.zip` file remains accessible in the `/tmp` folder of your site. This can pose a **security risk**, as anyone who can access that file path may download your private component package.

> **Important:** Always delete compiled `.zip` files from the temporary folder to ensure your work remains private and secure.
> *This is especially important when developing commercial or client-specific extensions.*

[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m22s)

## Setting Up a Blank Test Website

[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m47s)

To test your component, it's best practice to install it on a **fresh Joomla installation**. This ensures that all tables and configuration data are created cleanly without interference from previous builds.

1. Go to your **test Joomla site**.
2. Use the installation link or upload the `.zip` package generated by JCB.
3. Click **Install**.
   Once the installation completes, Joomla will display a success message confirming that your component is installed.

## Adding Database Information from Paid Versions

[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m19s)

If you start with the **free version** of JCB and later upgrade to a **paid version**, note that the **core functionality remains identical**-the difference lies only in the **database data** included.

Paid versions include additional preloaded datasets such as more field types, demo components, and configuration examples. You can integrate this data manually if needed.

---

## Accessing Database Information in Your Component

[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m49s)

1. Locate your compiled `.zip` file in your file system.
2. Extract it and navigate to the `admin/sql/` directory.
   [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m02s)
3. Open the `install.sql` file. This file defines the database tables for your component.
4. Scroll to the bottom of this file to view **dumped data entries**.
   [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s)

In the **free version**, only a few entries (like field types and help menus) are included.
In the **paid version**, the SQL file contains a richer dataset, enabling more predefined field types and configurations.

## Option 1: Uninstall Free Version and Install Purchased Version

[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m05s)

The simplest way to switch to a paid version is:

1. Go to **Extensions → Manage → Manage**.
2. Select your existing Component Builder installation.
3. Click **Uninstall**.
4. Install the new (paid) version you downloaded.

> Joomla only creates tables during a **fresh installation**, not on updates.
> Therefore, uninstalling ensures the new version's data is properly installed.

[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m29s)

## Option 2: Import Database Data Manually via MySQL

[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m41s)

Advanced users can manually import database content:

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** or another MySQL management tool.
2. Locate the relevant JCB tables (e.g., `#__fieldtypes`).
3. **Truncate** the table to clear old data.
   [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m30s)
4. Copy the SQL dump data from the paid version's `install.sql` file.
5. Replace the table prefix (`#__`) with your actual Joomla table prefix.
6. Paste and execute the SQL query.
   [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m49s)

This will update your JCB tables with the richer dataset from the paid version-without reinstalling the entire component.
However, this approach requires SQL knowledge and careful handling.

[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m29s)

## Installing the Paid Version

[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m53s)

If you uninstall the free version and install the paid one from **VDM.IO**, you'll start with a clean slate:

* No old component data remains.
* Only the updated field types and structures are installed.

After installation, navigate to **Components → Component Builder** in the backend.
[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m20s)

You'll see an empty component list but with a full set of **enhanced field types** available for future projects.

## More Field Types Available

[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m15s)

With the Developer (paid) version now installed:

* Navigate to **Field Types** inside Component Builder.
* Notice a larger selection of predefined field types.
* Some demo fields and configurations are also included.
  [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m44s)

This version provides an excellent foundation to begin building complex Joomla components.
The tutorial will continue by exploring **Field Types** in detail as the next step in your JCB journey.
