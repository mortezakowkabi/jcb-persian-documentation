# INSTALLATION OF JOOMLA COMPONENT BUILDER

We are in Component Builder at the Dashboard in the back end of a Joomla website. I would first like to show you the tremendous power of what it is able to do. And then step back, little by little showing you how to build a Component. I will first show you the Components, that I have build and how I have been able to manage them. I have a few here, obviously I have a lot in Archive, but these are a few that I have done. As you can see, these are the Component Builder for Developers. There is the Component Builder for Developers and the how to's. And there is the three Component Builders, and all three of them are living inside the same Component Builder. The only difference between them is the database in certain things that they compile. But they all are using [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m10s) the same admin views. They all are using the same infrastructure, information, settings, and so forth. It is that simple to have one component, and have it in different versions made available to your clients. Which is all possible in Component Builder by simply copying one and then making changes to that copied one. Now it links to views and all that I will explain as we continue. What I need to do now is, I am simply going to take the Compiler and I am going to compile the public, the free one, because I am going to use that to show you how to build your own Component. I will compile it, which starts up the compiler and all the script, taking all the data in the database [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m14s) and puts it into the code. Then we would need to run the application. It is done compiling as you can see it tells me how many lines is written it tells me how many hours I saved if I had to write those lines manually you can read through some of that it's quite interesting obviously I spend much more hours on this than what they says there but that's why these are just estimates And based on calculating the 9 numbers and not really Calculacting the actual interaction that we've had you can install the Component if you've done it right just click in there or you could download it and install it elsewhere or we could use this URL which is now at the moment relating to my offline Environment and once you've done whatever you wanted to do if you click this [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m18s) Whom you needed it but if you're running on the online Environment and you use some of these links to install it elsewhere then play Please remember to clear your temporary folder because if your don't this component Can be downloaded in your temporary folder and to show you that it me open that website And then let's go to it's temporal temporal folder And you can see there is the component in a zip file and And you you realise that anyone that can access this file can download it So just let you know it I'll be mentioning this a few times because I realised part of why Are you might be interested in using my application is because you want to ensure that what you do remains Yours and this is part of what you need to know to ensure that [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m22s) Ok I'm gonna run a I have a bash script that reminds me That I haven't made a commit on this so that's just my own little Script let me quickly do that before we go on ok it's done I'm gonna open a test website and I'm Gonna run everything there let me just login ok so I'm in the installing Area is basically a blank test website just installed And I'm gonna use this link here I use a URL paste it in there and click install it should say the following to you When you have done that just a side note if you've started working with component Builder As a free version and you've purchased obviously one of the paid versions [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m26s) The difference between them is only the data that is in the database the features and the functionalty Are all the same And so if you have installed the free version You would need to now add the database Information from the paid versions Now to access the database information in your component Let me see I'm gonna go to the zip file here in my file system hold on Ok we've got the zip file open here Would go to admin [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m02s) Then go to SQL Then you'd see there is an install file Now this Install file You'd wanna open it And Guarantee you would see it  it's the file that we are using to build a database And Once you've come finished looking at all the Tables at the very bottom of the file [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s) After the tables Will be dumped information Now with the free version It's basically the field types That we've added And also some I think help menu information If I'm correct. I think I've added that Anyway With the paid version there will be many more or much more details there [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m59s) And and there are two ways for you to do this one would be simply to uninstall the free version and install this one that you purchased When you do updates it will never Update this information Joomla only uses this when it doesn't fresh install Because that's the only time you create the tables I didn't add this data to and install instance since that would be Way too much And [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m29s) So I've realised that They are I might look at building a script that could deal with this but I haven't done so yet The second way to do this is if you might know My SQL You can actually Cut and paste this into My SQL replace this with your prefix of your tables But first remove The data that are in this tables Let me show you that please hold on So here we're in My SQL and there is the Database [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m03s) Tables of component Builder And if you look at our archive were is it now this one You see that this is gonna target the field types So You go to field types If you're now importing the new data And you go to operations And you Truncate that table Like that [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m30s) Then you go to My SQL The sequel button You go back to that file Obviously First replace All those with the Prefix like that Let's make sure we don't by accident grab the wrong stuff So we have it like that [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m15s) Match case Says backwards And then Find So we would replace that I'm gonna have to replace all Here we go back to our data you would see it now I has updated this field there So I would select that Like that Copy [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m49s) Go here To My SQL paste it And click Go Test The mistake I made is to leave to underscores in that name there should just use one Let's try again Ok it's added it [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m29s) So that is how you would Add the data Without Uninstalling The whole component But I would suggest that this is maybe More advanced than and difficult And not ideal So the other way would be to go to the extensions manage And click on [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m53s) This manage area here Select Component And just uninstall it And then reinstall the one that you now could download from VDM.IO So once you've have Got it installed it should look like this in the backend You should be no components No Nothing while the free version [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m20s) Should have none of this The only things that will have his the field types and only a few of them Now the paid version looks different and so I'm gonna uninstall this free one And then I'm gonna install the paid one so we can use that as our example let's go Uninstall and as you can see it not only remove the component but it also Removes any trace of it that was integrated into Joomla These three and tags and all that Which is quite smart because then if you install it again it's doesn't start creating duplicate values in the database Ok so let's quickly get the paid version Ok we have it installed [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m12s) So now if we go back to the component And to field types You see that it has A whole lot more field types And it has a few Fields setup as well In fact This is the version called Developer which only has the demo component in it I'm basically gonna use this version to show you how to build Sermon distributor [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Eux157428&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m44s) From scratch So I possibly would skip certain things because it might get too long But I'll certainly show you From the ground up how 7 distributor is to be built And I'm gonna do it inside this version And at least we have something to start with Ok well That's enough for this tutorial We'll continue with Field types in the nextOk here we are in component builder at the dashboard in the back End of a Joomla website I would like to 2 first show you may be the tremendous power of what it's already Able to do and then step back little by little showing you how to build a component So I'll finish o u components that I have build and I have been able to To manage them so I've got a few here obviously got a lot a lot in Archive what these are few that I've done and as you can see there is component Builder 44 the Gallop is this component Builders for developers and how to And there's the three component the order and that all three of them are living inside the same Component builder the only change between them is really the The database in certain things that they compile but they all are using The same admin views they all using the same Infrastructure information settings and so forth So really it is it is that simple to have one component An Avid in different versions made available to your clients and All possible in component builder by Simply copying one and then making changes to It's one now it links to views and all that I'll explain as we continue What I need to do now is I'm simply gonna take the compiler And I'm gonna compile the public the free one because I'm gonna use that to show you How to build your own component ok so I'll compile it Start up the compiler and all the script taking all the data in the day Metabase and puts it into the code that we would then need to run the application Ok it's done compiling as you can see Tells me how many lines is written it does me how many hours I saved if I had to Road right Does lines manually you can read through some of that it's quite interesting I'll be I spend much more hours on this than what the sense there but that's why these are just estimate And based on calculating the 9 numbers and not really Connecting the actual interacting action that we've had you can install the car Component if you've done it right just clicking there or you could download it and install it Swear or we could use this URL which is now at the moment relating to my offline in Environment and once you've done whatever you wanted to do if you click this Womane need it but if you're running on the online Environment and you use some of these links to install it elsewhere then play Please remember to clear your temporary folder because if your down there this a component Can be downloaded in your temporary folder and to show you that it me open that website And then let's go to it's temporal temporal folder And you can see there is there is the component in a zip file and And you you realise that anyone that can access this file can download it So just let you know it I'll be mentioning this a few times because I realise part of why Are you might be interested in using my application is because you want to ensure that what you do remains Yours and this is part of what you need to know to ensure that Ok I'm gonna run a c if I have a bash script that reminds me That I haven't made a comment on this so but just my Script let me quickly do that before we go on ok Done I'm gonna open a test website and I'm good Gonna run everything there me just login ok so I mean the installing air Area is basically a blank test website just installed it And I'm gonna use this link here so are using URL Then there a click install it should say the following to you win Dumb that just a side note if you've started working with component Builder As a free version and you've purchased Beastly one of the paid versions The difference between them is only the data that is in the database the features and the function Colour all the same And so if you have installed the free version You would need to now at the database Information from the paid versions Now to access the database information in your component Let me see I'm gonna go to the zip file here in my file system hold on Ok we've got the zip file open here Would go to admin Then go to SQL Then you'd see there is an install file Install file You'd wanna open it And Guarantee it's it's the file that we are using to build a database And Once you've come finished looking at all the Tables at the very bottom of the file After the tables Will be dumped information Now with the free version It's basically the fuel types That we've added And also some I think help menu information Correct Anyway With the paid version there will be many more How much more details there And Belt two ways for you to do this one would be simply to uninstall the freeways in Uninstall this one that you purchased When you do updates it will never Update this information Joomla only uses this one it doesn't fresh install Because that's the only time you create the tables I didn't add this data to and install instance since that would be Way too much And So I've realised that They are I might look at building a script that could deal with this but I haven't done so yet The second way to do this is if you might know MySQL You can actually Cut and paste this into MySQL replace this with your prefix of your tables But first remove The data that are in the stables Let me show you that is all done So you were in MySQL and there is the Database Tables of component Builder And if you look at our archive was it now this one You see that this is gonna target the fuel types So You going to feel types If you're not importing then you data And you go to operations And you Truncate that table Like that Then you go to MySQL The sequel button You go back to that file Obviously First replace All those with the Prefix like that Let's make sure we don't by accident grab the wrong That Thanks we have it like that A match case Search backwards And then Find So we might replace that I'm gonna have the place for Here we go back to our date are you see it now I has updated this field day So I would select that Like that Coffee Go here To MySQL Basted And play Go Test The mistake I made is to leave to underscores in that name there She's just you one Let's try again Ok it's added it So that is how you would Add the data Without Uninstalling The whole component But I would suggest that this is maybe More advanced than and difficult And not ideal So the other way would be to go to the extensions manage And click on This manage area here Select Opponent And just uninstall it And then reinstall the one that you now could download from BBM that i o So once you've have Got it installed it should look like this in the backend You should be no components No Nothing while the free version Should have none of this The only things that will have his the fuel types and only a few of them How the paid version looks different and so I'm gonna uninstall this free one And then I'm gonna install the paid one so we can use that as our example let's go Uninstall and as you can see it not only remove the component but it also Removes any trace of it that was integrated into Joomla These three and tags and all that Which is quite smart because then if you install it again it's doesn't start creating duplicate values in the database Ok so let's quickly get the paid version Ok we haven't installed So now if we go back to the component And to feel types You see that it has A whole lot more fuel types And it has a few Fields setup as well Impact This is the version called Developer which only has the demo component in it I'm basically gonna use this version to show you how to build Summon distributor From scratch Song or possibly worse keep certain things because it might get too long But I'll certainly show you From the ground up how 7 distributor is to be built And I'm gonna do an inside this version And at least we have something to start with Ok well That's enough for this tutorial We'll continue with Fuel types in the next
