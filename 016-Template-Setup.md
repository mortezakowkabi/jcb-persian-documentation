## Overview

Templates in **Joomla Component Builder (JCB)** are reusable layout structures that can be applied across site or admin views. They allow you to define and reuse HTML or PHP blocks that dynamically pull data from your component's views and fields.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:

1. Creating new templates
2. Copying and modifying existing templates
3. Managing language strings
4. Adding custom scripts and JavaScript
5. Understanding how templates integrate with site views

## Creating Templates

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)

In the previous tutorial, we explored how to set up templates and layouts for a **site view**. Inside a typical site view-like `preacherpanel`, `preachersmall`, or `preacherbox`-you'll find templates loaded to define how data is displayed.

To view or modify these, go to:
**JCB → Templates**

Here, all available templates are listed, each corresponding to a layout used in one or more site views.

## Creating or Copying Templates

[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m27s)

To create a new template:

1. Click **New** in the JCB Templates area.

   * You can also copy an existing one by selecting it and using the **Batch → Copy** feature.
   * Click **Process** to complete the copy.

[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m49s)

Open the **Preacher Panel** template (used in the tutorial example).
This area contains the **HTML view** of your layout. If you prefer using PHP, toggle into the PHP editor mode. You can switch back and forth as needed.

**Tip:** Use text placeholders (`{placeholder}`) in your template to make content translatable and dynamically replaced when rendered.

## Language Strings

[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m20s)

JCB automatically adds your text strings to the **language file** of your component.
By default, it manages **British English (en-GB)** entries.

If you need additional languages:

* Follow Joomla's standard approach for adding language overrides.
* Copy the English file to your target language (e.g., `fr-FR.com_yourcomponent.ini`).
* Translate each line accordingly.

[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m44s)

### Layout Snippets

Within **Layout Code Snippets**, you can:

* Embed **layouts** inside templates.
* Nest **templates within templates**.
* Reference existing layouts for modular, maintainable code.

This behavior is consistent with how layouts and templates are handled in Joomla site views.

## Adding Custom Script or Code to a Template

[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s)

Each template includes a **Snippet Box**, which allows you to quickly insert scripts or inline logic.
For example, you can add a small PHP or JavaScript block relevant to your template's data display.

The **Preacher Panel** example in the video shows how inline script can enhance a view's interactivity.

**Best Practice:** Keep business logic in your view's model or controller, and use snippets only for minor UI behavior.

## Adding JavaScript to a Template

[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m46s)

In the **Details** tab of your template, you'll find a note about adding JavaScript.

To include JS:

1. Wrap your code in `<script>` tags.
2. It will automatically load into your component's frontend page.

[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m13s)

You still have full access to all **global "this" field values**-meaning your JS can interact dynamically with JCB's runtime data.

[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m35s)

Templates use the same setup conventions as **site views**, except that they are **not standalone views**. Instead, templates are included **within** a main view via Joomla's `getTemplate()` method.

## Loading Templates Dynamically

[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m02s)

To load a template from within a view:

```php
echo $this->loadTemplate('preacherpanel');
```

This method includes the specified template file and renders it with all available variables.

[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxKeeubhiY&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m29s)

This is how your template becomes part of the main component view, ensuring that all scripts, code snippets, and translations are automatically integrated.

## Summary

* Templates in JCB are modular layout pieces that can include HTML, PHP, and JavaScript.
* You can **create**, **copy**, or **extend** templates easily from the JCB interface.
* Language strings are managed automatically for English but can be extended.
* Code snippets and JS can be safely added for UI customization.
* Templates are linked to main views via the Joomla `loadTemplate()` method.
