# HOW TO CHANGE EXPORT VALUES AND SETUP CUSTOM IMPORT OPTIONS

* ### Example Components

A short explanation of how to change the values that are being exported and to have a Custom Import option with an import of the data.  Component Builder allows you to have import and export function by default in all the List Views of the components. [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m35s) The component called IP Data is used to take a IP address and translate it to determine from which country it came and then a costing update is performed on your website based on that IP Data.

 * ### Example IP Tables

Select IP Tables which is on the IP Table Dashboard. [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m07s)  The 'CNTRY' value may be seen, that is the country, and the 'REGISTRY', which indicates to who the IP table belongs and the range,'IP from'/'IP to' is being reflected. 

### Export Feature

If 'Export Data' has been clicked without selecting any values, it will give this warning: 'Please first make a selection from the list'. [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m35s) Only export values that had been selected. If  all needs to be exported, change this value to 'all'. In some instances, if the table is too long, it is not possible to export all the values at once.

Exporting the data in large quantities is not advisable in Joomla.  If quantities exceeds 3000 items, rather go to MySQL and get a dump file. [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m16s) Although it is often seen that the Listview is being used for up to 10000 items, quite complex inheritance in structure is involved. But in this instance having the import and export in mind, makes it quite different. If for example this need to be exported but for some reason this 'ZZZ' or 'AUS' value should instead be replaced by the country name, the following would be a simple implementation of how to perform it.  [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m51s) 

### Exported Example In XLS Format

Click 'Export', save this(Opening Ip_tables). It has been exported, all these AUS values are displayed, and some other values from the database as expected. But if it is suppose to be a different value when it is exported, then take the next step.

 ### Export Data In Code

Component Builder has this 'getExportdata' method in the model.[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m26s) 
This 'getExportdata' method has this extra value called '$_export' set to 'true'.[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m52s) A reason why this had been added, is to target this(See video) method with custom scripting. But the difficulty is that this part($group to $query) is custom scripting and it is also been added into the actual 'getlistquery'. [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m21s) It is the same custom scripting. In the compiler the same custom script is added into the 'getlistquery' as into 'getExportdata. The way to know where it gets executed, is through this value '$_export'. [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m49s) This value is not set in the 'listquery', it is only set in the Export Data. 

### Admin View - PHP - (GetListQuery)

The custom scripting is done in the 'Editing the Admin View' area. With the Admin View open, go to PHP and then  scroll down until the method ' Add PHP (getListQuery - JModellist)' can be seen and then it should be set to 'Yes'. [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m43s) The code, that is put there, is added both to the 'getListQuery', as well as to 'exportquery'. If the values need to be changed that had been exported, but not the values that's being shown in the component, it have to be done in the same area. It will be noticed that the same code appears in two distinct places(See video). [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m22s) If some value needs to be changed, that may be done simply by adding another 'lookup', and add this '$_export=true'. To see where all this '$_export=true' is appearing, go to any List model and search and it may be seen in different places(See video). [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m55s)

Go to the 'getExportdata' area. In the previous tutorial it had been explained how to add some customization to the values in the 'listview', some HTML, Here(See video) should be determined if the 'export' is 'set' or is it 'true'? 

NB. Don't add this feature here. [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m25s) 

The adding of this customization of coloring is avoided because it should not be running during the export process. Only the values is needed. Again it can be seen that the export values are used. [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m53s) That is the places where the export function is involved, and by using this '$_export' it is possible to identify whether it's an export or not. If it is, changes can be made to the values as necessary. Going back to the back end just to show that this(PHP area) is the place where the query had been done. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,


And this is the place - before the translation fix, decryption. We are checking whether we are doing an export. And so you could literally take that(see video) [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m30s) and say instead of the exclamation that if the export 'isset' and export is true, then over here do your thing in that area there. That is if you want to change the values before translation or before decryption or if you want to you can do it after that. So after all was done you want to change the values [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m18s) on an export. Then you can add it there. And that is really as simple as it is. Adding a change to your exported values. 

### Import Features Explained

Now if you want to have a different import type as usual. Usually to import values you just [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m40s) update these. If you leave the id in it updates, if you take the id out it creates. Now let's say I don't want to use the ids I want to use these values instead. And then you need to create a custom import concept. We have tried to make that easy as possible and yet it's still quite complex. [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m13s) 

### Custom Import Tab(default import code)

You basically go to custom import. There is a little warning, because it is quite daunting. You add there yes, and it will load into these areas, the actual script that are used by default in these various concepts. [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m38s) If you do not understand what you seeing here, I suppose you should rather not be trying to do this or you should seek some classes from lynda.com or elsewhere. Udome it's also a good place sharpen up some of your PHP skills. Then you could make changes to this, for example take out that chunk, [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m09s) then do a search, put something in you can find like your name or whatever. Save and compile it. Go and search where does this come up? Where does this come out? What is happening? You'd realize that [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m31s) we don't completely remove the default import method when you do this kind of changes. There is a way that you could make these changes, and have two import methods next to each other. It's not that easy but it's possible and it all depends on what you are doing in [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m59s) this HTML and PHP view area. So it depends on what you do in the view. Currently this is set up to do your normal import as you would usually do. Changing this will also change your normal import concept. That is how you would Change your custom import concept. Please read through the code. Maybe compile it. [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m33s) Go look at what it's done. Look around see how the default import and concepts work. Then make your changes accordingly. I have used this area quite a lot for various applications, because sometimes you have a user that says to you or a client, I want to import these sets of csv files, and they are like 4000 or 40000 lines and it needs to select only specific values. [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau5mZ6naLc&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m06s) Well in that case this area is definitely what you looking for. You'll be able to adapt your import concept to accommodate those kind of complexity. Well that is how to change export values and create custom import values for any field view in the back end of your component. So literally changing how that button behaves and how that one behaves is what I have just shown you.
