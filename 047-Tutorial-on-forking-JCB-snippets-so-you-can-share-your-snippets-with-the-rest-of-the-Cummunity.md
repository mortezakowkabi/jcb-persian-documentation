Now that we've given you a general overview of how are things work And then you slip it manager I would like to Take You The Next Step and that is Showing you how to take shits limits And Basically Show them There are two things that should be done What is You need to f*** The JCB community Snippets On get up so you will need a get up account The second thing Is once you Done that You would export the Snippets here that you would like to contribute And you will add it To this Repository that you fought and cloned down to your developing environment And you would make commit messages on every change that you are Intending to make The second thing you wouldn't do Although there are few steps in each of these Things the second thing is that you would then Make a pull request So this tutorial I'm just gonna focus on the 1st Few things you need to do And that is just to get you Basically ready All the things you need to do until the very point when you are now ready to actually do a pull request Ok so now There are three things that I suspect we can do one is to improve Already existing snippet And then contribute that to the community The second thing is to move and existing snippet To a new type this isn't something I hope will happen often but it can't happen That a snippet is in a specific type that is not the best suit for it And You might wanna suggest us changing that So that would be a second thing And the third one Would be to actually add a whole new snippet completely So I think I'm just gonna demonstrate all three of those And then we'll see how that all plays Out Until the very point where we are now ready to make a pull request Ok so first thing First We need Repository And we need to understand get Now if you do not know get The story is not gonna cover that You need to do your homework And study upon get When you do an export of a package for example if I were to click here on these 3 Heeren Clickshare Snippets You see that it ends up showing you a bunch of links here and one of them is quick start forget On you to me At this link here I just searched on Google found it I didn't actually watch it myself I hope it's not bad If you got a better one Please share it On on the issue somewhere and will will improve this link I'm your even if you've got your own and you would like us to promote your Tutorials on get sure Why not We will support those who support Our community Very gladly Reality is You need to get some Your head around some of the git basics So that you can actually do A Fork of the JCB Snippets on get up And then make a pull request So this Video here is the one I'm busy making so it will end up that being that link how to 4 JCB Snippets and get all this done And then after that I'll be making this video So we'll get to that in a moment Ok Now You need a an account on GitHub And so I'm just gonna use my own account And Simply go and Fork the repository and use that as the mistration So needless to say I've got an account I've gone through all those hoops And now I'm simply gonna Fuk this repository To get to this repository It's this your all up here Another way to get here Is You go to get Snippets And then the moment it's finish loading there is a link that you can click which will take you To the GitHub repository and it's this link over here so we could click that And as you see we're end up at the same place Picket So you could either just Follow this URL appear all good just use that link But you wanna get to Joomla component builders in the pits And I suppose Since everybody that wants to contribute will need to fork it I'm I speak this number she will change And of course well this is part of his like 6 days old I haven't even finished the ReadMe So there will be a lot of changes to this Repository and it will improve So the first thing you do is click on this button here and forked repository This will then ask you to select Where you want to f*** it if you belong to organisations whatever but then Obviously by then I don't need to explain to you how it works But if for some reason you don't then you select your personal or whatever organisation You want a fork to appear in And then it will basically To copy this repository For you Ok so now it's busy doing that I'm basically just copying it into my personal Account Now Good practice Every time you wanna make it change Then You need to follow a few steps In Having this repository in sync With the What we call upstream repository this is EDM dot IO Joomla component builder Snippets This is what we call the upstream All the master branch or whatever you wanna call it this is the main Bronze the one that is being used inside of JCB yours is indirectly being used So whatever changes you make here would not necessarily affect us at all But you obviously 1 m Commit your changes to your branch And then Make a pull request To the upstream branch Where you would like to share this with the community So that's Sort of a quick explanation we'll do this slowly I'm not gonna do the pull request Now in this tutorial But I'll take you all the way up to the wall and then we will get the ladder out and finish that in the next 2 Ok so once you've done this for king of the main Repository You need to clone this repository down Do your own developing environment And So that is what I'll do next You would click on this Clone and Depending on how you've got get set up on your developing environment Again those tutorials you need to do before coming here You would select either SSH or https I I would suggest using 8 SSH as this is of course more secure But ok So we'll just copy that and then we go To I'm just gonna use my My New users home folder for now So here I am in the command line I'm running Linux so if you're running using Windows You need to watch tutorials on how to do get in Windows You might end up using it to land Stead of command line But if you did that you also be having had watched Tutorials to help you sort of understand what I'm doing Ok So first thing first we gonna clone it let's get that done So I cloned it And we now have a folder Call Joomla component Builders titbits So I'm gonna change into that folder now Just with a CD and a folder name and there we go I'm in the folder And if I do la Sunday will basically see all the files That was on get up now in that folder Now we wanna change these files But we not gonna change them directly We're gonna use Jason B to do the dirty work for us Because we might have issues with escaping and all kinds of things that can go wrong So just to have good convention Whatever changes wanna make even if you wanna add files or new libraries whatever You do it in JCB and you do the export package And you should check that if you export a snippet That it has 3 Values always set And that does free values Well will obviously scrutinise it when you make her pull request But that those name conventions B standard It's quite important as you can see this but got the library name you I kept And it's uppercase you and space lowercase V2 And then common with uppercase And that is the type of snippet And then it's the name And obviously to Jason file So This is the convention And at this stage there should be build that for you And I'm gonna show you where it gets this convention Because to follow this Convention is what really gonna be very important If you making a new Snippets For the uikit version to library You need to ensure that your Version 2 naming in your system is the same as it is here And if you are adding a new library that isn't already in our repository Then you need to make sure that you use The naming as found wall As others will understand it as most common The most common naming convention And obviously if you need help on that you can open an issue and ask one of the admin Do you know Maybe give you a suggestion of what To call the library But The Long and the short end of it is Please stick to the naming conventions Don't change this UI kit To maybe the remove the space here or something like that Because it will end up Just miss matching things and I want a boy that from happening Ok so first thing with done with fork to repository and wittnauer cloned it Do offline developing environment And now I'm going to go to get it so sorry to JCB And I'm gonna export does 3 slip it's the one is a new snippet The second is a changed or improved snippet And in the 3rd is when you actually move a snippet to a different type What I'm gonna target here Is the Messi Think it's Not showing here now I hear this Food table The food table snippet Is that the moment in layout I think there is a better Type for this snippet and I know the slip it isn't At this stage maybe the best We could add some more food tables lipids but I'll leave that to some with you to do The point is I'm gonna move this one To the tables because it is a table right So that'll be the one change I'm gonna make then I'm gonna add one snippet To the UI kit versions 3 Since those tickets are still coming I'll just add 1 as they mistration and then I'll make a little change To one of these Snippets just for them istration ok great let me do that Ok first thing a food table click on that one Change it from layout Two tables I'm gonna make any other changes I'm just changing the type And this brings us to those three values that must always be set And shouldn't change unless it's really seriously necessary the one is the name You wouldn't wanna change this name unless you are hot pressing sure it should be changed Because in effect it will create a new snippet Because the way the Snippets work it builds the filename With name The library and the type Ghost Recon ponens together makes up the file name To changing any of those will in effect greater New snippet And create a duplicate And that's really wanna would try to avoid that And I realised This is gonna what I'm doing here now is inevitably gonna cause that And I think it will show you why it's not a good thing to do it But so I'm doing this more really for demonstration And so the ideal reality is that when we add a snippet we added to the correct library and type And give it the correct name From the start and it we don't need to change those three again If we do Most of the time I would expect That your pull request will be rejected Because this will mess up many conventions and cause Many duplicates across the system In other developers environment where they would in Port this new snippet And yet end up having two of the same Snippets Ok I've said enough about that I hope you understand that important this part is So let's go ahead save and close The next one I'm gonna do Is basically add a new snippet now since I've done this recording Second time now I've already done that and this is a support and slip it here So you'll see that I've basically Set the Disa JavaScript snippet It's an accordion It's your kid Version 3 I look down these types I'm wonder if some one of the other guys won't be better at this identifying of the types So I might even Not be the guy to make the call on this I really am open to some With better perspective Maybe knows these libraries assorting It is better I think there's a place called What is it Collapse Yeah cool apps Accordance could also fit other under this collapse I suppose No let me do that I know the difference the cordian we added for UI kit version 2 That is actually found on the JavaScript But then we didn't have these many types So I'll just add it on a disc prolapse for now Again I realise that this might be a difficult thing And What could help is going back to the actual Rea library itself This This is the The link for it And to try and see how they Organised it and that's the problem Uikit Didn't Give more breakdown besides calling it components So it's only call the component it doesn't Specifically added into a type Warehouse Bootstrap is doing a little better at that So that's why I'm not sure exactly where to place it now Transport strap Actually adds it on the collapse I think we won't go wrong to do the same So save and close There we go we got now A very crazy risky change of a type And a new snapper 12 let me take another Snippet and just make a little improvement to it I think I would use this UI kit version 2 Form snippet I'm just gonna add some usage information to it Ok there we go And I'm gonna save it 7 clothes So now I've made a change Basically two This one This one and that one and So those are the only ones I'm actually going to share This one when I created it it added my details As the Contributor Which if you created a snippet You know add your details you will notice when you create a new snippet It takes a while before it's finish saving and it's because it's actually phoning Get up And trying to see if there isn't a snippet Already with that Relationship as explained in a previous tutorial And that takes a while and I'm still wondering if that's the best idea If we should continue doing that I'm open for Suggestions But at this stage we just try to confirm that That's not good Wasn't already created And to avoid conflicts Now That means if it doesn't find it it adds your details which is set here in the option Global options And as I explained in that tauriel You can add your details and you would get some Uno exposure out there the community With your details there With is that I've just changed The contributor will stay the same But your name will come in on the blame Layout And your GitHub name will display there as recognition for your support Ok so now and next thing share Snippets Well the reason I Made it that it actually compiles is zip File Because it's easier to move around We could argue that we might want to just have it zip Or remove Rather move the Files right into your A local cloned Folder And so I am thinking at this stage maybe We should add a switch here in the global options That could make you choose it to do this or the other depending on what is most convenient for you So I'm gonna go take the snippet And then I'm gonna go and basically unzip it into That Repository that we've cloned So here we are in that folder I'm gonna first unzip it right here There there is those 3 files That we want to make part of the repository Now like I said I Actually clone to repository right into my Hey user Folder So let us go to that folder Just got a Cup this year Cut And then paste It right into that folder Now we are updating 241 file So it's asking it really contains this file Now so when you make an improvement on a filed your obviously have to replace it So we click replace Now that you've Added those two new files And you have Replaced one of them The third one You see that we now have this Food table The tables version And we have it also Add the layout version now one of them needs to go We don't want to pick it So you have to remove this one but Don't remove it via the The Interface Use use git To remove the file So that you can also add a message So that when you make your pull request and we see their files removed It will know why you did it And obviously then it will become a discussion And this will demonstrate in the next tutorial Ok so let's get back to command line Yeah we are we can say get Status to see what happened and we see wow ok one of been modified and these two have been at The first thing we wanna do is remove the one that we don't want Now because we have chosen to leave spaces within a file names You need to In put the file name in quotations To ensure that it actually you know Not misunderstand what you doing So we will go do a get rm4 remove And then the file name So You could click tab after typing food table about there and then lay out and it Will basically grab the name for you And then click enter So it is removed it if we now and do get status Will see that it's in the deleted Area and you need to actually Make a commit 22 Explain what you've done so it's get Commit m And removed table layout Since I Moved Did Food table skip it Tables To the tables type So We're not at this stage exactly sure How we are going to What kind of conventions we gotta follow with these commit messages There are reasons to have a few conventions here I just haven't had time to sort of get my head around it 7 L What is keep it basic But I'm sure as to community development things will become more Explained and so if you need help Will most probably have some documentation up At some stage 2 to get you Do you know how to Correctly do a commit message I mean just what you should say first and what you shouldn't say and those kind of things Ok so I've got a key that signs of every commit they make You may not have that don't worry about it it's not really compulsory at this stage It's just the way I can make sure that everybody knows That it's me Ok Now The next thing here is we wanna Add these new file so if we do get Status We'll see that now that file is been Made part of the commit At other branch All the local files of this clone And we wanna add those to other files The first one I'm gonna Target Is adding the food table which we just removed So get Status Oops Ok so now we've got that one added And we need to give it a commit message Now I understand When we are doing such Dangerous thing as moving a snippet to another type I would expect us to actually make a commit message for every Step of what we're doing But if you're adding Like A Whole New Library and you got like 300 new Snippets that you contribute in I wouldn't mind you adding all of that on the one commit message Just making sure that the it was exported Biodermal component Builder So that we don't have You know the wrong kind of code within does lipid files And obviously we will at the Pull request Will scrutinize those files and we will have to look through them to insure That it won't make any one system unstable And so we basically got a police some of this to do in sure that nothing gets you know Merged into the master branch That will put every anyone at risk as much as as far as we are able to To prevent that be wanna do that Well we working with step it so it should be fine but just in case we wanna be careful So when you making changes to one specific snippet And you're not really like doing Many at a time I think be as detailed as you can in your commit messages Because the more we know of What U doing I think the easier it will be too much it into The bronze and to basically approve your pull request So the next commit message I'm just gonna say Git commit Message update the food table layout food table Dotson to food table Table Food table dot dress incense It is more correct slipper type Ok so that would then Deal with that added file No we want to At the accordion which is the the new snippet So it's just get Ad and we can select the file name There is a shortcut to this It's when you use the dart get data done that's usually when you have lots of files who just wanna add them all She's like I explain if you doing in a whole bunch of sleep it's for a specific library I would suggest doing library the library instead of just mixing them all up Because if we target a library and just add a bunch of stuff that's for it And then have a commit message just for that then we could explain that within the commit message That it's for the specific library and so forth Because usually with new libraries You know it's good for us too Sorry take it one step at a time SA now with added that file now just got a commit message for it I'm just gonna say added to Accordion snippet For you are cute Version 3 as demonstration On how old is should work Ok and then just again Sign-off that's Commit Get status We'll see ok with but once I left and we already 3 commits Ahead Of our Our Branch that we have Cloned So just this last The fire which is the You know the update we made So We got a first aid the file And then add a commit message To explain what we did Araby uses paragraph to explain how to use the euro conversion to layout form Yeah I think just writing out file name like that is Clear enough And enter Going to sign off on that Again if you don't have Keys to Ben It's good Gogo Google this Start signing your request But at this stage it's not requirement as I said Ok if we do get status now Will see that we are 4 commits ahead Now this is here where We wanna do a few more things To your Commit all sorry to you all Your fear Forked And therefore cloned repository Is what we wanna do something that will keep Your Repository in sync with the upstream So I'm just gonna go and Google this quickly This is a very helpful document We first need to do this configure a remote that points to an upstream repository So let's first look at that one So this gives you Little explanation Of you know what you should do So First you basically List the current Remote branches That you have So I've done that and it shows us that I've got this kid What do you origin And it's the fetched and they pushed Remote branches Now It's gonna I say specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with this fork So we'll use the original owner and the original repository Name Which In our case is the following The original owner is this VDM Dot IO and The repositories this one So the get that name You could come here And Yeah think you could get This name here There we go That part Properly So going back to Outlook tauriel We will not type the Get a n I suppose you'll have to get the https version Since you will not have permission to Work with the SSH version So let's get the http one Which basically means that you should click http here And then grab that version just copy it And Control Shift we will paste it in Into command line or some Command line 7 gives you this option to paste With a mouse Ok so now we got that there And we press enter So it's now Typo Try again I didn't add remote add So it was looking for a file Ok there we go now if we did that version Will see now It has this upstream there is well Ok so that was just add to remote All the upstream Repository to the Cloned Version that you have here Now let's go see how to keep it in sync So here it says that you would open the terminal And you were to get fetch upstream And it will basically pull down This And make sure that there is a branch called upstream Master When you Checkout Master And switch to the master branch Undo merge upstream Master Which if while you were busy doing the slip it's improvements and things And there's been commits to the master branch You wanna make sure That you Actually before pushing all this upstream Before making a Piano pull request that you first merge The already Changes from the master branch Into your bronze and then make your commits on top of that This will help to try and avoid You not having specific commits in your branch I know it gets a little bit complicated Carrot fit If you get stuck We will most of the times be able to juice help you Figure this out again But like I explained in the beginning To know how to work with Gate Is really your responsibility So that You when you are wanting to communicate or sorry to Share with the community Snippets You know how to first make a pool Request a sorry merge Your upstream with your master branch And ensure that you are up-to-date with that before making a push Absa to your branch and Yes I hope you understand anyway if you don't please Google it and do some homework to get you Get Knowledge or freshen up and ready No I know we didn't make any changes to the master branch during this tutorial So I can demonstrate the process of Kitt Fetch Upstream And it will do that But since I know that we didn't actually make any changes In the end of the day We we will not be Really seeing any Great fireworks happening right now And I suppose some of you will experience it a little different Especially if there's been changes to the upstream Value UniPIN working So get Checkout Master It's usually the bronze at your own but just to make sure You're ready on the master branch Then get Merge Restart to get there Merge Upstream Master And it says like now it's already up to date If it wasn't it will actually Merge does two branches With the changes you've made Now That's what you should do before you do the following Get Porsche Which will now take these changes you've made And you wanna push them Two origin Origin Master Now Everything you've done All the commit you made all the commit messages the files you removed All of that now gets pushed up To your cloned version On GitHub So if we go to your version now on get up And we just refresh the page You say This branch is 4 commits a head of EDM IO Master Which means you are now ready To make a pull request A pull request is what we will do within the next tutorial So everything we've done so far and this tutorial is to get the Snippets that you've changed the contribution You wanna make Into the branch that you worked And to do it in a way that you're not completely out of sync With a master branch Which is living Basically on medium dot IO Joomla component Builders tippets This is the Master branch that you thought So you've got those commits in your fork branch And now you want to actually make A pull request Too much these changes you've made into that Master branch So that it will eventually become available To the whole community of JCB Ok thank you for watching If you have any issues Please Google Do research Get is an amazing technology and The quicker you can Get your hands on it and Become Comfortable with working with it the better Ok Next tutorial Will deal with the pull request
