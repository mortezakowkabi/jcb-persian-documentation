Hi I've got your ma Install here with JCB Joomla component Builder 2.5.6 I've got quite a lot of components That I have Imported From another day CB And Basically all of it is working If we were to look Inside of them It really looks the way there but it should And it's expected Now Jamar has Conveniently Decided to Get rid of this repeatable Field Which pops up into a little Model And So we have systemically been removing this field From JCB Just to show you We've already done that And other areas of JCB Like in the language area We were too Open Any of these Language strings You see that we already have the repeatable field Set up here Now This would have been a simple as changing the fuel type Within JCB to achieve Only Reality is that the compiler As well as one other feature which is the Joomla components Can be exported in jsp packages and imported And so These features are mapping into these component concepts Hello there Fuel structurally how old data stored In a Jason By the Pitbull fields Are different from how it's being stored in the subform fields Are gonna go into explaining what a difference is There is actually If you think it's been open on get help about this And so We have Taken on the task of the Sporting all of this With this next release which is JCB 2.5 point eight The whole admin View area Will now be moved over to this new form Sop form layout So if I was to open an app then View now It basically has The old Repeatable field concept As you would have learnt with all the tutorials we've done So your permissions is one of those tabs the fields The conditions the linked fields And then you have a list of the fields that are linked to the admin View And you've got some custom buttons you could Setup and it's also A Repeatable field As well as linking a sequel Clicking on table this is also repeatable field Unimodal So all of these different fields on our gonna be moved to subfields Because of space and statistics We will Move some of these Fields into tabs I will try and do it in a way that seems obvious and that he wouldn't feel lost So just up front The fields This Fields button Are are going to be moved To the fields tab And so does The conditions move there They will be in new tab called settings so basically this tablet stay there And will call that details and a new tab with settings And the rest of the repeatable fields that are remaining On this side will be placed there Ok so that's just a heads up on what's gonna happen But this is gonna happen really without you doing much Basically all you need to do is upgrade And We have added a number of scripts Did you can actually go and look at On Gear Bob if you like And I'm doing this recording The stage in bronze Is where you will see these changes So Basically if we were to go to the script This is the script that will Convert The Fields and all the tables and everything Images go down to that area To hear we have a function Inside of a method More like an anonymous function And Basically this is what converts the repeatable fields So I'll be using this function over and over As you can see we've done It was so upgrade to version 2.5.5 And Then there is another upgrade with 2.7 which was not really released because I'm having made this This change We still need to to convert the repeatable fields And that will continue to run until 2.5 point 9 Now The way does this Is it really Targets The various Up here There's to convert repeatable function at Target all these fields Chicken C Inside the admin View And it passes it over to this Convert repeatable Which is really going to do the work and this function Like I said if you can look at it Are we here If you are uncertain of doing this You can come and look at this function here And I will now also demonstrate that it actually does work well The only thing that I have actually noticed It's like with this website that we are working on here We talking about houses of values Well Even more than thousands And I have found it It sometimes does not convert every single value And so because of that We actually did another fix Which Goes beyond and ensures that this upgrade will not cause any Internal conflicts And that is within the Back end And within the model There are a few places where these Newfields will now exist One of them is conditions Field conditions and the other one is as admin Fields so open that one Open this one And obviously Anna Or not Not that one Sysadmin View These are the models in which these field changes will take place And you see that within the Get item Method at the very end Of this method In the admin View We are at a function Which would basically check If this These Fields were updated during the upgrade And if it were not updated That is while the field is busy loading and you're opening the page Ill check whether it's been updated If it's not updated it will actually make Do the update And add it to the update object And then basically check every field All the way down To hear And then if it says that there is been any one of those fields Found to be You know ready to update Then will run the update And after that it will never Do it again Because you see the way there A the arrays constructed This Will no longer exist once it's been moved to a subform Storage The subform array structure is different So Once you open any of the items it will automatically convert it and make sure that it's gone Converted The other thing that we've done Because you most probably will not all open every view or every Admin View Is Even when the new admins Fields we've done the same So you can see here In the Athens Fields we are also making sure that that update is there And the same with the ATT and field conditions It's also there But then there is one more place where we also add these Checks and that's actually in the compiler So even if you didn't go and open any of these views and you just went straight to the compiler And try to compile in of your components The compiler obviously now been adapted Do instead Actually Use the new sub form structure Within it's compilation To within the get file where most of these sop forms are now needed We have In the get admin Functional images get there 4 years to get admin View Method of function class method And you see we are checking Weather in still in a repeatable field And if he is We convert it And we again started to the update object That While it's getting this one at the view at the very end So every where it's doing it check If it's not been converted converts it's it's back to the data set And also to ensure that we store it back into the database Little Stream And So It Goes On Doing it everywhere Where we You know expect To define values that still You know may have been missed And then hear it very end of this function Which is a little Figure supposed If we found that there are any updates we run the update And after that that view is been updated and it will never need to be updated again so these are the chi Kind of Trichazole How can I put it Fixes really That we put in place when you already have a JCB with Anna enderson down today Data and it is just too big to do just with the normal install Then all these admin views will B Updated and adapted As you start using JCB And you should not really anywhere at any time experience Any conflicts In fact if you do the reason for me making this tutorial Is it you can actually get into the code And if you can You know Open an issue on GitHub And give me heads up so I can You know Pat's whatever you find And push it out the rest the community Ok so that was just a quote side of things now getting back to 2 hour install here I think what I'll do is I'll What is open Maybe this afternoon And then I'm gonna go And Basically Install The The upgrade I'm just gonna selected it's not been released yet So this is a pre-dinner station Just to ensure everything works So if it doesn't you even see that So let's just select this file from my computer Ok there it goes busy installing it It should take a while it's quite a big dataset And you can just wait it out It wouldn't shouted you if it missed certain values I don't know why doesn't but Head goes You upgrade been successful And you are now on washing 2.5 point eight And if we were to open that at interview Which Basically locked Like this And now just refresh it It should now look like that So you see it's moved These Fields to the side There's now a settings field And as you can see all the data is just been updated and moved to subform Her values Same with the tabs And if we go to field and conditions Here we go That's all the new field and conditions view looks like Now Because of many reasons we couldn't keep the subform fields within the admin View Especially when you Start having Morgan 50 admin Fields which in my case I have quite a few of those it's not advise of Because it actually causes the tremendous Hello slow down on page load I mean imagine each of these lines are actually want 2 3 4 5 567 8 9 10 11 12 13 fields Have you start having a huge a lot of those fields Which you could have up to 800 By the limit with set it really takes a long time to load that into the page Ok Enough about that how does it work now Well you could either click on this edit button here Or this edit button here to actually go and edit these and change their values If you would like to just edit one specific field You could click on any of these In a pencil editing Links So for example if I click on name It will ask me whether I've saved all my values in this current View And yes I just click ok And it will now open the name field And I can L come in here do any edits that I'd like And then save and close or just close out again if you wanna one leave an ID to get some information Now Back into This area The same goes with the custom Fields I could click on any of those to edit them Or I could click on this edit here And it will Ok ask me if I saved all my work And then if I did KKK And opens Those values right here A nice new trick with added is that it only loads the fields That are actually linked to the Saturn Vue So that you can only Target The specific fields Which really makes sense Dit Those are the fields that needs to be targeted With this conditional option Then you could also create a field but reading if field will not Necessarily add it to the admin View It will just make it available to you If you were to have You know add it By going to admin fields Oh yes let me just say this this button here I just wanna hear the same button This is this is a shortcut Because sometimes you might have a lot of fields And it's a way down there to get two conditions So we added some shortcuts up here There's also the tutorial On how to use this but the toriel still was made when we had the old Fields layout It should still make sense I mean you just need to keep in mind that things change the little Keep it click here On any of these links To actually open That area where the fuels on our found And make the changes So that's really the new admin Fields and J moving away from repeatable fields To start using subforms for all our Repeatable concepts It's really what This upgrade is all about There is 1 heads up which I know is little different to Hell things with done previously Let me just close out of this Open View Oh yes I could just mention this Here is a shortcut to get to the admin Fields without opening the app and do and then opening the admin fields You can click on this right here L automatically take you 2 beatin' fields And you can make changes here And obviously it's link to the look Area I looked at in View And the same is true when looking at The conditions they're the second button here is for conditions The thing that has changed is if you create a new admin View Now Utopia SLI add the single record name the list record name the short description And the system name And that's really all you need to add To save the admin view for the first time because B admin you view at this stage It cannot be linked 20 Fields until it has an ID No I might still work from this and trying You know Junit in a way that When you click the button and if the Admin views not save it saves it for you But I haven't done that yet so at this stage Since the admin field doesn't have an ID it's still new because we haven't clicked save Even once You can't link any Fields to them Do it so what you would Natural do is just add some Hero name here And And then just save it once And having done that if you now go to Fields and conditions It basically says create To the Spartan here and that one hears the same button Click on any of them to do create fields So if you would create a field So yes I did save everything And then Hi You can just click on this plus over here And there's a first field and you can start you know adding fields And treat them as you would before And Yep so there you go That's the new sub form Fields for admin views And that's what this upgrade is really all about I trust that it all benefit all of us in the future And make it more easier for us to transition into Joomla 4 And
