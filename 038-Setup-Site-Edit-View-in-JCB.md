Hi I'd like to quickly give you a tutorial On how to Basically add An admin View To the front end of your site So There can be editing and submission Of the front end of this specific admin View now Illustrate this [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m23s) I'm gonna use the public version of JCB And it has this demo Version in it so basically first I'll just compile it and install it to the local Joomla website So we can see what happens And then install it And then basically open it So here we have the The demo version That is publicly available and it basically has a admin view called "Looks" [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m07s) So if you go to the list you of the admin View I call Looks you see there is none, we will create new And then There is basically a description box A more item where you can click And see some Custom Fields and fields Being built sorry email mobile birth Image website And your normal publish and permission structure for the view [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m37s) And the name field Now that's basically what I referred to as the admin View It's this combination of fields working together in one View Now what I will show you is how to add this Editing area, basically the these three tabs To the front end of your site So that it will function like a form Now who you would allowed to access the form will depend upon the permissions structure You see the permission structure Is what [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m14s) Actually controls who can edit And who can add Items to a specific admin View So currently as you can see your public cannot actually edit this If we created an item They cannot edit it so there's an item level on permissions and if I Close out of this Then you'll see here in options there is also a global control on Permissions So the global control of permissions [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m46s) Is also if you want public to be able to submit To to this form you need to Allow them to be able to create so you would say allow And now the public is allowed to create And You see that usually Most components has more than one View This one only has one it's called look So you'll also have to Over here [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m13s) Say allow And if you want them to edit existing submissions Then there is the edit State edit own created by All these things in the Global Spec as well as in the local edit of The View So there is basically two switches here one is a Global switch and one that is specifically focusing on the view so if you cannot access the view on the front end After we've created it it is actually would need to come back to to this area and And sort out the permissions for the specific group Who should have access to the specific View On a front end [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m57s) so this permissional structure is quite intense and Extendable so that you can target specific groups with specific permissions and so forth For every View The JCB bolts in the admin As well as site Ok let me cancel out of here I'm not gonna Make any further changes here So we basically in the demo component now I'm gonna go back to JCB and basically I'm gonna flip one switch and then JCB will actually develop or write the code [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m34s) For the site end of this component So I'm going back to JCB Going to components And I'm opening the component And now in the component there is an area called settings where obviously all your admin views Are linked right so I'm gonna open that Are usually there is a little bug in Joomla which if you open it the first time it doesn't Reflect the original setting So I usually just open it cancel it and then open it again and you'll see that the original setting is [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m17s) Is back And You see here that Edit create site view Must be set to "Yes" If it is set to "Yes" then it means that it's gonna create a site view Off this look as so that you can edit it on the site end and not only in the admin Area And it also means create items So I'm just gonna save this [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m44s) And then also save and close And then go back to compiler Compile Demo I see that off Go Install it Now let's go look at the code So looking at the demo websites folder structure we are going to components And then we'll see that there is a com underscore demo folder [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m19s) And we will see there is the modules as well as the controllers As well as the views So there is basically This is the view that was dynamically generated By JCB review called look And then the model also called look And the controller Are you can open that To actually see what was the code that was written [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m49s) And so as you can see it's basically looks very similar to the admin area except that it's been slightly Modified For your front end And it's requirements As you can see we were adding Some CSS classes and JavaScript From the back end And Then Here is the model [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m16s) Basically get item get form And then here is the controller Ok so we just showing at the code just basically what was created Now The fact that this was created Doesn't mean that there is actually Now set of links That you can click and edit the forms which was submitted or that there is a link to create any So these these things is what you need to do manually [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m51s) Now so Let's show you some of that as you can see there is two views here In called on the site views And one is called looks and other one is called looking As you can remember the one we looked at here Which I said was automatically generate is called look so that one isn't actually showing because it was just a tick box that created this whole view model and controller So you don't need to build The look view again [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m21s) But you need to get links to it Ok so In looks we are using a dynamic get And in looking as well so let's let's go to the dynamic get page So there is one called looks and looking so good let's go to the looks dynamic get So as you can see here is the dynamic get for the look Looks and it got a custom script area Were basically we're asking whether the items are set whether there are items and then we looping through them And during the looping process we basically determine By this ScanDo script here [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m10s) You see in the helper class there's a get action function The get action function asks whether look item With the current user has the edit option To the specific look item And if it does it actually in this little script here It builds an edit look button And dynamically adds that to the edit link Which is coupled to the item And then just continues on So it basically dynamically generates the button for edit here in the dynamic get [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m48s) Are you could have done that anywhere I just decided to do it here because then it actually gets added to the model which is more Where your logic For lots of your data structure should be placed And ok so now if you go back to this to the views the site views And we open the looks site view You see that we got the main get set as looks And here If you scroll down Well basically [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m25s) In this area here we are looping Through the look items And Echoing the edit link After the description And that means now the link that we built here in the dynamic Get Which is the button Will either be empty and therefore show nothing if the user doesn't have the permission to edit it Or it will actually show a button You also see [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m04s) There is currently as I look at this I haven't actually added A a link For creating new Looks and The same would be required to do that So You could use the same button script just copy that And Here at the head before the table You could [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m29s) Add a button to create new looks Now All you would need to change is basically This link here That it will have an ID to zero And then it will actually create a new Look So that's a quick tutorial On how to add An editable [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m53s) Admin View to the site End of your component And then link it into your side view so that you can basically click on a button and edit A specific ID View Or create more And then control that with this get action helper class Method Which gives you Basically whether it can be edited You can go look at this helper class in the code [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m23s) So let me just quickly open that for you So here in the code And helpers We open Demo PHP And we scroll down Until we get the method called getaction Where is it now Ok here it is [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m50s) getaction Around 540 depends on how much the customer scripting there is been added And You can go through this logic To see that we are dealing with a number of Concepts and trying to determine the permissional To edit own And to create and so forth And it all gets stored And given back to you [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m17s) Basically in the result set Ok So You could also just echo out the result var dump or something In the look to see Exactly what is the result that you get from that structure So If we go back to The looks here View [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m42s) Let's just open that model You see that the custom scripting we looked at Basically gets added here From JCB That custom scripting that creates the button So you could come in here And you can just add a var Dump Exit and Take this can do [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m06s) And Login as any kind of user on the site And then When you basically load the page it should show you The can do List Of that specific User Group Also keep in mind that here's the authorities setting That is applicable to the looks site View And it also controlled in the permission structure [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmB22d9dQ4M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m33s) So there's a lot of permissions automatically being added to components build in JCB And you need to always keep that in mind It might look like things don't work while it actually works very well you just Haven't kept in mind that there is a permissional Structure And that you need to adapt that permissional on structure as it's fitting to your project Ok well thank you for watching Hope this helps
