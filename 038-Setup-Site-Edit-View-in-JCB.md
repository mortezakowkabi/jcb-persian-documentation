Hi I'd like to calculate give you a tutorial On how to Basically add An admin View To the front end of your site So They can be editing and submission Of the front end After specific admin View now Illustrate this I'm gonna use the public version of JCB And it has this demo Version in it so basically first I'll just compile it Uninstall it to the local Joomla website So we can see what happens And then install it And then basically open it So here we have the The demo version That is public it available and it basically has a admin view called looks So if you go to the list you off the admin View I called looks you'll see There is None will create new And then There is basically a description box A more item where you can click And see some Custom Fields and fields Being built sorry email mobile birth Image website And your normal publish and permission structure for the view And the name field Now that's basically what I referred to her as the admin View It's this club combination of pills working together in one View Now what else show you is how to add this Editing area basically the these three tabs To the front end of your site Total real function like a form Now who you would allowed to access the form will be dependent upon the permissions truck You see the permission structure Is what Actually controls who can edit And who can add Items to a specific admin View So currently as you can see your public cannot actually edit this If we created an item They cannot edit it so there's an item level on permissions River Close out of this Then you'll see here and options there is also a global control on Permissions So the global control of permissions Is also if you want public to be able to submit To to this form you need to Allow them to be able to create so you would say allow And now the public is allowed to create And You see that usually Most components has more than one View This one only has one it's called look So you'll also have to Over here Say hello And if you want them to edit existing submissions Then there is the edit State at its own created by All these things in the Global Spec as well as in the local edit of The View So there there's basic basically two switches here one is in Global switch and one that is Saflii focusing on the view so if you cannot access the view on the front end After we've created it it is actually would need to come back to to this area and And sort out the permissions for the specific group Who should have access to the specific View On a front end Ok so this is what this promotional structure is is quite intense and Extendable so that you can target specific groups with Pacific permissions and so forth For every View The JCB bolts in the admin As well as site Ok let me cancel out of here I'm not gonna Make any further changes here So we basically in the demo component now I'm gonna go back to JCP and basically I'm gonna flip one switch and then JCB will actually develop or write the core For the site end of this component So I'm going back to JCP Going to components And I'm opening the component And now in the component there is an area called settings where are viously all your admin views Are linked right so I'm gonna open that Are usually there is a little bug in And you wanna wish if you open it the first time it doesn't Reflector original setting So I usually just open it cancel it and then open it again and you'll see that the original setting is Is back And You see hear that Edit create side view Must be set to yes If it said 2 years then it means that it's gonna create and side view Off this look as so that you can edit it on the site end and not only in the admin Area And it also means create items So I'm just gonna say this And then also save and close And then go back to compiler Compile Demo I see that off Go Install it Now let's go look at the code So looking at the demo websites folder structure with Anna go to components And then we'll see that there is a com underscore demo folder And we will see there is the modules as well as their controllers As well as the views So there is basically This is the view that was dynamically generated Bye JCB review called look And then the model also called look And the controller Are you can open that To actually see what was the code that was written And so as you can see it's basically looks very similar to the admin area except that it's been slightly Modified For your front end And it's requirements As you can see we were adding Some CSS classes and JavaScript From the back end And Then Here's the sorry the model Basically get item get form And then here is the controller Ok so we We just showing at the core just basically what was created Now The fact that this was created Doesn't mean that there is actually Now set of links That you can click and edit the forms which was submitted For that there is a link to create any So these these things is what you need to do manually Now so Let's show you some of that 2 as you can see there is two views here In cold on the side views And one is called looks and other one is called looking As you can remember the one we looked at here Which I said was automatically generate is called lock so that one isn't actually showing because it was just Is the tick box that created this whole view model and controller So you don't need to build The look view again But you need to get links to it Ok so In looks we are using a dynamic get And in looking as well so let's let's go to the dynamic get page So there is one quart looks and looking so good let's go to the looks of a dynamic get So as you can see here is the that I make get for the look Looks and it got a custom script area We basically were asking whether the items are set where there are items and then we looping through them And during the looping process we basically determine By this can do script here You see in the helper class there's a get action function The good action function asks whether look item With the current user has the edit option To the specific look item And if it does it actually in this little script here It builds an edit look button And dynamically add that to the ETA edit link Which is coupled to the item And then just continues on So it basically dynamically generates the button for edit here in the dynamic get Are you could have done that anyway I just decided to do it here because then it actually I get added to the model which is more Where your logic For lots of your data structure suit should be placed And ok so now if you go back to this to the views the site views And we open the looks side view You see that we got the main get set as looks And here If you scroll down Well basically In this area here we are looping Through the lock items And Echoing the edit link After the description And that means now the link that we built here in the dynamic Gate Which is the button Will other be empty and therefore show nothing if the user doesn't have the permission to edit it Or it will actually show a button You also see There is currently has a look at this I haven't actually add it A a link For creating new Looks and The same would be required to do that So You could use the same button script just copy that And Here at the head of the tub before the table You could Add a button to create new looks Now All you would need to change is basically This link here That it will have an ID 20 And then it will actually create a new Look So that's a quick tutorial On how to add An editable Admin View to the site End of your component And then link it into your side view so that you can basically click on a button and edit A specific ID View Or create more And then control that with this get action helper class Method Which gives you Basically whether it can be edited You can go look at this helper class in the code So let me just quickly open up for you Vienna code And helpers We open Demo PHP And we scroll down Until we get the method called Get action Where is it now Ok here it is Direction Around 540 depends on how much customer scripting there is been added And You can go through this logic To see that we are dealing with a number of Concepts and trying to determine the permission or To edit own And to create and so forth And it all gets stored And given back to you Basically in the result set Ok So You could also just echo out the resolved bar down for something In the lock 22 C Exactly what is the result that you get from that structure So If we go back to The looks here View It is open that model You see that the custom scripting we looked at Basically gets added here From JCB That custom scripting that creates the button So you could come in here And you can just add a bar Dump Exit and Take this can do And Login as any kind of user on the site And then When you basically load the page it should show you The can do List Of that specific User Group Also keep in mind that here's the authorities setting That is applicable to the looks site View And it also controlled in the permission structure So there's a lot of permissions automatically being added to components build in JCB And you need to always keep that in mind It might look like things don't work while it actually works very well you just Haven't kept in mind that there is a permission is Structure And that you need to adapt that permission on structure as it's fitting to your project Ok well thank you for watching Hope this helps
