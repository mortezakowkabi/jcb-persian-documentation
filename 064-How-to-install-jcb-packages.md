I would like to give you a quick tutorial on how to install A JCB package Organ port Is the right word relief Now At the end of day You already have JCB on yours System So I'm not gonna explain how we got to this point But from here on further There are two ways to To get to the in Installing View One is by clicking on this icon I'll take you there The other one is going to Jabula components And there is a button Up here this is important Packages And that will take you to the same place You see that there is another of tabs here And you can actually If you don't If you're not interested in these Tour tabs There's action option in the global options Where at this point we are controlling those tabs Through this Global switch that says manage data package the directories You can say show all Shounen Or manually select The repositories that you want the show at the moment they are then he's 2 But they are Reasons to expect that they might become more Us We see You know This area becoming more active Ok so Once you're on this page And you have yourself exported a JCB package then this is where you can select it from your Computer Or from a directory Or from a URL And with these import methods There is not a checksum validation feature in place So you need to be sure of the Integrity of that package We cannot validate that package integrity And since if it's being Selected from your desktop and you are in a your local development environment There should be no reasons for concern If you're pulling it from an external source Then possibly You need to be more cautious Where is it when it comes to the medium packages and the JCB community packages These are the areas where we are trying to add some layoffs Purity To try and protect you And to ensure that The package area remains as stable as possible And so there is ways for you to add your own Daisy package To the community repository Here is a tutorial to show you how to do that And Also Explaining Why We will do things The way we do them Because of The fact that everybody will then have access to that package In this area You can then also also Now get free keys For the medium packages The past you have to pay for them And we have decided in In a initiative to Sort of Show all of you exactly how they speak and work and function We have decided to give these packages way Asking you to follow few steps In supporting Us by For king starring or Were watching These packages in their specific repositories on GitHub Are you needing more guidance about this You can just click on that link And all show you exactly what you need to Do I want you Got the key for that Safic package You can come and select that package here Obviously It's only related to some of the packages at this point Which the first being Most prominent Component builder itself And so I would say Suspect that would Would be your First Choice Is Well At once you've selected the package you simply can click on Get 2 How the package be Taken From GitHub And Broad To your Developing barman And in doing so It will actually run a validation on the Integrity of the package Because they are checksums In place But You need to validate the check song Manually And why you do that Is ill show you the checksum that was used Elevate The Package integrity And since it's past the validation You know the district some is the one that you need to see If you're open This link Total opening this link will also reveal a checksum But at this time you will be seeing a verification Bye Dizzy Shirt And It must be at least This part of the year l Must be correct There This will vary from packet But it should have the package name here And this should correspond To the value you See here And that little bit of manual effort All you need to do To be sure that the package that you have now got In your position Is the original authentic package that we have Beauty So at this point you're all good to go or did it now Take the key that we have sent you And to add it here To the key area Bikesa Now you need to make a choice Whether you want to if the SACP already is installed on your system maybe it's the second time you doing Then you might not want to merge you might want to have it be like a clone I like a second instance of JCB it will literally Then create all the fields and all the views And all the linked Concepts Again Where is if you choose merge And There is a change in the package which is newer Then the version you have it will Actually update That version If you wanna force it To update it You will say yes up here The force local update really Only Words If you selected merge Then there's also show all import information Which year was the first time that you're importing package It might be ideal to to check this too Because it was show you literally everything that it does every field it adds But not showing names of sweet ID so lot of it will be like ok that doesn't make sense To see anyway But at the very bottom of the list It shows you that Files that is moved and this is what you need to see You need to see the files that is moved in Into your system Specially if it's not a package that we are providing Or someone else that is being Sort of validated through the community But it's someone that you've Imported through a URL Walkthrough package from you Distributor package you received Or from a directory Then you most certainly wanna C o import info Because you wanna make sure that what they told you is what you get and that's what that little feature is all there About Then there is also the component that is being imported should show Here the same as the one you saw before we got the package Now there's a few that have used this area multiple times You will know But you're actually able to add Multiple components into one package It's just because they we had BBM Are distributing one component at a time That's why there's only one component in the package But in in Integrated perspective You can actually import a backup package Right here And that would be Then everything That you have done So in my case I all the components out build are actually zipped in a bucket patch package And I can import all of those into JCP at once at the moment I've tested it up to at least 20 components which is It takes a while but it and actually gets there Ok so at this point Everything looks fine And you can click continue This depending on the size of the component All the size of package Might take longer and shorter And I was just a dress that you wait it out Take a sip Coffee or something It it does take a while because literally at this point It is updating the ideas Everyone One at a time So with every field the ideas are being updated with They review and everywhere that ID in any other ideas being used anywhere across the component Everything is dynamically being updated During this process And So as you can expect it is a lot of Compilation Lot of algorithm Lot of things happening under the hood And therefore does take a little bit longer than You might expect Because the ID is changed And the way we export the package Is literally Just taking a photocopy of the package as it is in the JCP where it was Develop Or when it resides And when you imported we now recreate and remap every ID To ensure that it remains functional although basically all it's identifiers Changed Ok so just wait and in the moment it will show you that it's been successful But it does take a while Once it's done You get this Longest especially if it was JCB Which you've imported I mean it's a long list It has over 1000 field so You can anticipate a long scroll Hunger and grabs Here Please try get And it goes and goes and goes And it's Huge But they're very much at the bottom you start seeing different things Like the files every little file that has been in Imported And that's really helpful If you are importing a package From a developer which you do not No or You're not absolutely sure we can Trust The now you must check Every one of these Fields that they are legitimately related to this component And that it is actually what you into Dissipated Or expected And you can also Therefore go look at these folders They are all related The custom folder At the moment as we scroll around here Awesome Folders that are related to the administrator BDM compiler Yes This is in the compiler so there's a lot of files for the car Bailar I draw 3 Then for the helper this This little thing here is just like her Space so really By which we sort of Create the string And so there you get all the files that have been moved into place and low me hold There is component builder the fully mapped Package In your sis And that's really as simple as it is to get The component that You need Fully map Into your system And as you can see All it's Views of Ricky Martin here And if you open any of those views Are you all again see that all it's fields Are also Correctly Map And You do realise that every one of these Fields their ideas have changed And even The fields They again Have field types And even those Might have changed The field types Itself And so Down to the very Smallest detail we've tried To make sure that every little thing All across the board Esri map And You know Fixed so that your component is again Fully Active and stable ready for further development Ok so that is the quick tutorial on how to import a daisy package into JCB
