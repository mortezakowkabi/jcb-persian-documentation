I would like to give you a quick tutorial on how to install a JCB package. At the end of day you already have JCB on your system. I'm not going to explain how we got to this point. There are two ways to get to the installing view. One is by clicking on Import JCB Packages icon. It'll take you there. The other one is going to Joomla components, there is a button [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEol.iopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m35s) tp right of the page, is Import JCB Packages. That will take you to the same place. You'll see that there is a number of tabs. If you're not interested in VDM Packages or JCB Community Packages tabs, there's an action option in the global options. At this point we are controlling those tabs through this [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m57s) Global switch, that says Manage JCB Package Directories. You can say Show all or None. Or manually select the repositories that you want the show. At the moment they are only these two, but there are reasons to expect that they might become more, as we will see this area is becoming more active. 

### Make Sure Of The Integrity Of The Package 

[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m20s) 

Once you're on Backup Local Data First page and you have yourself exported a JCB package, then this is where you can select it from your Computer, or from a directory or from a URL. With these import methods there are not a checksum validation feature in place. You will need to be sure of the integrity of that package. [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m44s) We cannot validate that package integrity. Since it's being selected from your desktop and you are in a your local development environment, there should be no reasons for concern. If you're pulling it from an external source then possibly you will need to be more cautious. Where as when it comes to the VDM Packages and the JCB Community Packages, these are the areas where we are trying to add a layer of security, [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s) try to protect you. To be ensure that the package area remains as stable as possible. There is ways for you to add your own JCB Package to the community repository. 

### Tutorial Explaining Why We Will Do Things The Way We Do

[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m28s)

A tutorial is provided to show you how to do that. Explaining why we will do things the way we do them. The fact is that everybody will then have access to that package in this area. You can then also get free keys for the VDM packages. In the past you have to pay for them. We have decided in [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) an initiative to show all of you exactly how JCB can work and function. We have decided to give these packages away asking you to follow few steps in supporting us by forking starring or watching these packages in their specific repositories on GitHub. If you need more guidance about this [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m22s) you can just click on that link. They'll show you exactly what you need to do. Once you've the key for that specific package, you can come and select that package. It only relate to some of the packages at this point. Which is the first [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m38s) prominent Component Builder itself. I would suspect that would be your first choice as well. Once you've selected the package you simply can click on Get Package [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m53s) that is been taken from GitHub and brought to your developing environment. In doing so it will run a validation on the integrity of the package, because there are checksums in place. [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m09s) You will need to validate the checksum manually. The way you do that, it'll show you the checksum that was used to evaluate the package integrity. Since it's passed, the validation you will know that this checksum is the one that you need to see if you open [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m26s) this link 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com'. Opening this link will also reveal a checksum, but at this time you will be seeing a verification By Digi Cert. It must be at least this(see video) part of the URL must be correct. [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m46s) This will vary from package to package, but it should have the package name. This should correspond to the value you see here. That little bit of manual effort is all you need to do to be sure that the package that you have now in your position [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m04s) is the original authentic package that we have distributed. At this point you're all good to go. All you need now is to take the key that we have sent you and add it to the key area. 

### Choose Merge - Change In Package / Force Local Update Works Only If Merge Is Selected

[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m19s)

Now you will need to make a choice whether you want to, if the JCB already is installed on your system, maybe it's the second time you doing this, then you might not want to Merge it, you might want to have it be like a clone.  Like a second instance of JCB it will literally create all the fields and all the views and all the linked concepts again. Where as if you choose Merge, and there is a change in the package which is newer, then the version you have will update [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m53s) that version. If you want to Force to update it, you will say Yes up here. The Force Local Update only works if you select Merge. 

### See All Import Information

[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m05s)

Then there's also See All Import Information. If it is the first time that you're importing a package, it might be ideal to check this Yes. It'll show you everything that it does, every field it adds, but it will not show your names or shows your IDs. A lot of it will be like that it doesn't make sense to see anyway. At the very bottom of the list, it shows you that files that has moved and this is what you need to see. You will need to see the files that is moved into your system. Specially if it's not a package that we are providing or someone else that is being validated through the community. [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m44s) But it's someone that you've imported through a URL or through a package from you distributor package you received, or from a directory. Then you most certainly want to see all import info because you want to make sure that what they told you is what you get and that's what that little feature is all about. 

### Component Being Imported

[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m04s)

Then there is also the Component that is Being Imported should show, the same as the one you saw before we have the package. Those of you that have used this area multiple times, you will know that you're able to add multiple components into one package. It's just because we at VDM are distributing one component at a time. That's why there's only one component in the package. In a greater perspective [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m32s) you can import a backup package. That would be then everything that you have done. In my case all the components I've build are zipped in a backup patch package. I can import all of those into JCB at once. At the moment I've tested it up to at least 20 components, which takes a while but it gets there.

?????
 Ok so at this point [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m59s) Everything looks fine And you can click continue This depending on the size of the component All the size of package Might take longer and shorter And I would just suggest that you wait it out Take a sip Coffee or something It it does take a while because literally at this point It is updating the IDs [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m21s) Everyone One at a time So with every field the IDs are being updated with Every view and everywhere that ID in any other ID is being used anywhere across the component Everything is dynamically being updated During this process And So as you can expect it is a lot of Compilation Lot of algorithm [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m41s) Lot of things happening under the hood And therefore does take a little bit longer than You might expect Because the ID is changed And the way we in export the package Is literally Just taking a photocopy of the package as it is in the JCB where it was Develop Or when it resides And when you imported we now recreate and remap every ID [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m05s) To ensure that it remains functional although basically all it's identifiers have changed Ok so just wait and in the moment it will show you that it's been successful But it does take a while Once it's done You get this Longest especially if it was JCB Which you've imported I mean it's a long list It has over 1000 field so [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m32s) You can anticipate a long scroll I'm gonna grab this thing here and drag it And it goes and goes and goes And it's Huge But they're very much at the bottom you start seeing different things Like the files every little file that has been Imported [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m50s) And that's really helpful If you are importing a package From a developer which you do not No or You're not absolutely sure you can Trust The now you must check Every one of these Fields that they are legitimately related to this component And that it is actually what you anticipated [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m09s) Or expected And you can also Therefore go look at these folders They are all related The custom folder At the moment as we scroll and now here Are some Folders that are related to the administrator VDM compiler Yes This is in the compiler so there's a lot of files for the [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m31s) compiler Joomla 3 Then for the helper this This little thing here is just like a Spacer really By which we sort of Create the string And so there you get all the files that have been moved into place and low and behold There is component builder the fully mapped Package [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m51s) In your system And that's really as simple as it is to get The component that You need Fully mapped Into your system And as you can see All it's Views are correctly mapped in here And if you open any of those views [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m07s) you'll again see that all it's fields Are also Correctly Mapped And You do realize that every one of these Fields their IDs have changed And even The fields They again Have field types [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m23s) And even those Might have changed The field types Itself And so Down to the very Smallest detail we've tried To make sure that every little thing All across the board is remapped [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m37s) And You know Fixed so that your component is again Fully Active and stable ready for further development Ok so that is the quick tutorial on how to import a JCB package into JCB. Ok thanks for watching.
