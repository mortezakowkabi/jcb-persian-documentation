I would like to give you a quick tutorial on how to install A JCB package Or import Is the right word really Now At the end of day You already have JCB on your System [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m16s) So I'm not gonna explain how we got to this point But from here on further There are two ways to To get to the in Installing View One is by clicking on this icon It'll take you there The other one is going to Joomla components And there is a button [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m35s) Up here this is import JCB Packages And that will take you to the same place You'll see that there is a number of tabs here And you can actually If you don't If you're not interested in these Two tabs There's action option in the global options Where at this point we are controlling those tabs Through this [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m57s) Global switch that says manage JCB package the directories You can say show all Show none Or manually select The repositories that you want the show at the moment they are the least two But they are Reasons to expect that they might become more as We see You know [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m17s) This area becoming more active Ok so Once you're on this page And you have yourself exported a JCB package then this is where you can select it from your Computer Or from a directory Or from a URL And with these import methods There is not a checksum validation feature in place So you need to be sure of the Integrity of that package [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m44s) We cannot validate that package integrity And since if it's being Selected from your desktop and you are in a your local development environment There should be no reasons for concern If you're pulling it from an external source Then possibly You need to be more cautious Where is it when it comes to the VDM packages and the JCB community packages These are the areas where we are trying to add some layer of Security [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s) To try and protect you And to ensure that The package area remains as stable as possible And so there is ways for you to add your own JCB package To the community repository Here is a tutorial to show you how to do that And Also Explaining Why [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m34s) We will do things The way we do them Because of The fact that everybody will then have access to that package In this area You can then also also Now get free keys For the VDM packages In the past you have to pay for them And we have decided in [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) In a initiative to Sort of Show all of you exactly how JCB can work and function We have decided to give these packages way Asking you to follow few steps In supporting Us by Forking starring or watching These packages in their specific repositories on GitHub needing more guidance about this [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m22s) You can just click on that link And they'll show you exactly what you need to Do and once you've Got the key for that specific package You can come and select that package here Obviously It's only related to some of the packages at this point Which the first being [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m38s) Most prominent Component builder itself And so I would Suspect that would Would be your First Choice as Well and once you've selected the package you simply can click on Get to Have the package be [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m53s) Taken From GitHub And Brought To your Developing environment And in doing so It will actually run a validation on the Integrity of the package Because they are checksums In place But [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m09s) You need to validate the check some Manually And the way you do that Is it'll show you the checksum that was used to evaluate The Package integrity And since it's past the validation You know this checksum is the one that you need to see If you're open [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m26s) This link So opening this link will also reveal a checksum But at this time you will be seeing a verification By Digi Cert And It must be at least This part of the URL Must be correct [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m46s) Up There This will vary from package to package But it should have the package name here And this should correspond To the value you to See here And that little bit of manual effort Is all you need to do To be sure that the package that you have now got In your position [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m04s) Is the original authentic package that we have distributed So at this point you're all good to go all you need now Is to take the key that we have sent you And to add it here To the key area like so Now you need to make a choice Whether you want to if the JCB already is installed on your system maybe it's the second time you doing this Then you might not want to merge you might want to have it be like a clone [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m33s) I like a second instance of JCB it will literally Then create all the fields and all the views And all the linked Concepts Again Where is if you choose merge And There is a change in the package which is newer Then the version you have it will Actually update [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m53s) That version If you wanna force it To update it You will say yes up here The force local update really Only Works If you selected merge Then there's also show all import information Which if it is the first time that you're importing package It might be ideal to to check this yes Because it'll show you literally everything that it does every field it adds [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m20s) But it will not show your names or shows your IDs a lot of it will be like ok that doesn't make sense To see anyway But at the very bottom of the list It shows you that Files that is moved and this is what you need to see You need to see the files that is moved Into your system Specially if it's not a package that we are providing Or someone else that is being Sort of validated through the community [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m44s) But it's someone that you've Imported through a URL Or through a package from you Distributor package you received Or from a directory Then you most certainly wanna see all import info Because you wanna make sure that what they told you is what you get and that's what that little feature is all there About Then there is also the component that is being imported should show [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m08s) Here the same as the one you saw before we got the package Now those of you that have used this area multiple times You will know That you're actually able to add Multiple components into one package It's just because we at VBM Are distributing one component at a time That's why there's only one component in the package But in in Integrated perspective [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m32s) You can actually import a backup package Right here And that would be Then everything That you have done So in my case all the components I've build are actually zipped in a backup patch package And I can import all of those into JCB at once at the moment I've tested it up to at least 20 components which is It takes a while but it and actually gets there Ok so at this point [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m59s) Everything looks fine And you can click continue This depending on the size of the component All the size of package Might take longer and shorter And I would just suggest that you wait it out Take a sip Coffee or something It it does take a while because literally at this point It is updating the IDs [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m21s) Everyone One at a time So with every field the IDs are being updated with Every view and everywhere that ID in any other ID is being used anywhere across the component Everything is dynamically being updated During this process And So as you can expect it is a lot of Compilation Lot of algorithm [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m41s) Lot of things happening under the hood And therefore does take a little bit longer than You might expect Because the ID is changed And the way we in export the package Is literally Just taking a photocopy of the package as it is in the JCB where it was Develop Or when it resides And when you imported we now recreate and remap every ID [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m05s) To ensure that it remains functional although basically all it's identifiers have changed Ok so just wait and in the moment it will show you that it's been successful But it does take a while Once it's done You get this Longest especially if it was JCB Which you've imported I mean it's a long list It has over 1000 field so [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m32s) You can anticipate a long scroll I'm gonna grab this thing here and drag it And it goes and goes and goes And it's Huge But they're very much at the bottom you start seeing different things Like the files every little file that has been Imported [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m50s) And that's really helpful If you are importing a package From a developer which you do not No or You're not absolutely sure you can Trust The now you must check Every one of these Fields that they are legitimately related to this component And that it is actually what you anticipated [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m09s) Or expected And you can also Therefore go look at these folders They are all related The custom folder At the moment as we scroll and now here Are some Folders that are related to the administrator VDM compiler Yes This is in the compiler so there's a lot of files for the [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m31s) compiler Joomla 3 Then for the helper this This little thing here is just like a Spacer really By which we sort of Create the string And so there you get all the files that have been moved into place and low and behold There is component builder the fully mapped Package [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m51s) In your system And that's really as simple as it is to get The component that You need Fully mapped Into your system And as you can see All it's Views are correctly mapped in here And if you open any of those views [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m07s) you'll again see that all it's fields Are also Correctly Mapped And You do realize that every one of these Fields their IDs have changed And even The fields They again Have field types [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m23s) And even those Might have changed The field types Itself And so Down to the very Smallest detail we've tried To make sure that every little thing All across the board is remapped [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmEoliopv8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m37s) And You know Fixed so that your component is again Fully Active and stable ready for further development Ok so that is the quick tutorial on how to import a JCB package into JCB. Ok thanks for watching.
