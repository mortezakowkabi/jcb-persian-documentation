Hi [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m03s) I would like to demonstrate to you How to upgrade to version 2.6 of JCB The upgrade is quite a major upgrade Because we are removing all repeatable fields in the Joomla component area Joomla component area Has quite a lot of repeatable fields If you were to open A component You'll see that [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m29s) Repeatable fields are basically Little models that pop-up With values And as been used quite excessively in this view The reason why we did that is because it's really a very smart field Because it combines these values into one value Basically the JavaScript on the page Grabs these values and converts it into one value Which on submission [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m01s) The form Only submits one string And not actually Several fields So to me it's Feels like we going a few steps back But I suppose there are some conventional Reasons which Makes The repeatable field [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m21s) On a subform level More desirable because of its Ability to actually validate the data more Correctly None the less We have to remove these Fields because in Joomla 4 they no longer are supported In doing so I had to decouple a number of these fields Into their own tables [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m48s) Because of the size that we would Of values that will have on the page The page becomes immensely heavy And so they're about 9 new tables Being added to JCB To accommodate this So the real Change Is Gonna effect only the components area But because JCB is very Dynamic component That actually integrates with various levels of this data structures [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m20s) I had to also upgrade the compiler As well as the import and export of JCB packages We have tested this and it's for the most part those involved into testing Have found That This transition is actually Major improvement to JCB And should be very easy and you shouldn't have any issues Those of you that might run into [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m49s) Little Glitches that doesn't work as you expect We would suggest that you clean your browsers cache as well as memory We found it Traces of the old repeatable field structure and JavaScript surrounding that Might clash with the new changes in JavaScript Within the new update So to clear your browser memory not just the cache is quite important only after you've On the upgrade [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m21s) And you started working in different views You should see that Everything Works as expected Now An area which even at this stage has been Been reported in giving some conflicts Is the dynamic get area The dynamic get area Basically returns values [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m45s) From The admin area Where if we target let's say backend View And we grab You know Some information These values are returned from the admin area Where it basically goes to this Admin View And Builds this structure [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m04s) Now as you can see with my demonstration here Everything is really working As expected If if you at this stage Would test this area before the upgrade You should find that it works Without any problems If it doesn't I would suggest clearing your browser memory and trying again Until you can find that this is working [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m35s) As you see mine working here And The reality is the only thing I've done is I've cleared my browser memory So that there's no all traces of JavaScript And what I say clear I mean literally going here to to history and just wiping everything For this domain if you don't wanna clear You know all of your history and it specifically targeting this domain That you are loading your JCB component in Ok so that is just few heads up for [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m10s) The current 2.5.8 The upgrade should be quite simple The release I've just released it like 8 minutes ago So you should just be able to go to you know updates in your managing area See that the upgrade is there and ready Click on it and click update There we go The upgrade is been done [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m41s) If we now go back to Joomla component Builder We should see That It's up-to-date And everything is Been done without any errors If we now go to the Joomla components area You should see [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s) A view similar to this With a lot of new shortcuts To these different decoupled Areas that I mentioned And if you open the component Not much has changed in regards to where what is located But how to interact with it is actually been moved so for example the component updates If you see it as what as a button here if you click its gonna Ask you first save everything before you continue [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m30s) If you've done so Then click ok and it opens the area where you then would do your updates Usually it was in a you know in a module Sorry a model that popped up And you could change it right there on the same page Now you simply go to another view and is basically doing the same So You just do that the same goes with your admin view custom view site view And basically everything else The contributor is we've moved down here so you could [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m03s) Do them on the page But for most of the other repeatable Fields we've moved them to their own tables The Fields and the folders we've moved To a joint table So if you were to click on that You should be able to Easily add Some files to your Component or folders All found within this [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m29s) Structure As it's explained here in the Note The same is true of all the other Areas it's basically We've moved The Admin views to It's Town tab So you could access them via this button or via this one [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m54s) And so here you would see your changes you could also actually from here directly edit The admin View That you've linked So It will be able to Edit the admin view directly out of your component area And So That That's a nice new feature Which [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m15s) I suppose will come in very handy Ok so that is really the new upgrade As really targets The majority of the changes is in the Joomla component area We do Have a lot of data checks all around JCB at this stage That if during the upgrade we might have missed a Field in not converting it to the new subform layout Then even when just opening a view it actually runs through all those fields And make sure that it's been [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m54s) You know changed and converted If by any means you didn't get around to opening the views and you just go here To the compiler And would click compile It actually Does that again it runs through all the fields And it makes sure that it's in the right format And therefore you're compiling should work just as before Now What are the new features we've added is this [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m23s) Translation checker Which basically checks how many strings there is within your component And how many you've translated for this specific version New language available For both the front You know sorry the admin view the admin system view the site view And again for the another language Admin view admin system view in the site view So basically giving you A little feedback on your progress Because we realised that this area of JCB is not [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m59s) May be utilised as much as it Can be So we bakes Making some awareness here But this area is available It only comes and becomes Active if you've actually got some language translation as sorry some languages set up So you need to have some languages in your Languages area And you need to have have compiled that component at least once before [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m26s) Because like you know by now that the The the language string stored in JCB found on the language translations Is only generated once you've compiled at least your component once Then it links the component language strings to JCB And you can translate them into those languages that you created The other problem which you now saw their with which regarding to The Back-up folder Because I haven't setup a backup folder for this JCB install It'll tell me if I leave the set to yes and I compile he'll tell me that it couldn't move that Backup file Because the temporary folder and the backup [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m11s) Folder is now the same place So basically it's saying it couldn't move The file to the same location And that means this is not really an error It's just a mis configuration Because we haven't setup The Back-up folder to be a separate folder from the temporary folder And then if you need some more help regarding the translation manager And please go watch this tutorial Here we do give you a notice the that you can even in the options area of JCB [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m42s) You can change the percentage of translation required Before a translation is added Currently it's set to 50% Which is actually not You know set in stone you can change that to any percentage that you like Ok so that is creating a component now with the new upgraded JCB And having just compiled that We can go back here We can see that the component was built And everything is working as expected [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m18s) Yeah so thank you for watching this tutorial If you run into any issues that you think is related to this upgrade And you have already cleared your browser memory Also note that I'm I'm using Firefox here Let see Firefox 64-bit Here we go Then please [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m49s) Open an issue on GitHub and we'll try to get back to you and see if we can get this resolved So far my experience is that this upgrade Is taken JCB into A very Powerful position Where it is now having No repeatable Fields anywhere In the in the component All is repeatable Fields have been converted And is now only subforms And [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m19s) We've added some nice shortcuts like you seen To these decoupled areas which means you can actually access them directly without going through The component view itself If you wanted to Work on for example The component dashboard You know you wanna make some changes to the dashboard Or you wanna just work on the admin views You can click on that link right here And work on the admin views without going to the component directly [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrLBYhvGyA&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m54s) Which I think is Very nice Convenience shortcut Which I suppose we'll make our life a little easier Ok Well Again thank you for watching
