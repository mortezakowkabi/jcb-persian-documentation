Out like to give you a Quick overview of the new implementation that we've had it To JCB That allows you to do translation We are a Excel spreadsheet It is really just to Make it easy for you to Build your component Extract your language strings Give it to someone else Have them do the translation in whichever language you like Have them give the spreadsheet back to you And imported into JCB without The necessary of struggling with Ini files any of that So that was what we wanted to achieve The other thing that you need to know Is a JCB Doesn't really work with placeholders When it comes to these translation strings It actually works directly with the English String And the reason we did that Is because the place holders Which in the Ini file is the Let me just show you Quickly If you look at these For example may be back This Word This English word here Might be ended up being used in multiple views the same English word But with a different Uno placeholder So What we did instead as we said to Ourselves ok To ensure that you always translate this Pacific English string only once We will only add the string and wherever it is reoccurs will replace it The string itself This should be an advantage I can understand that That you might want to have a different Lee But this is how we've gone about doing this And so when you think about create new Great new comes you know is used Many places over in In the Annoying the files It's sorry In relation to these placeholders But you only need to translate it this create new ones And we will add it The compiler will add it Correctly In every other place where it belongs So that's really The first thing you need to keep in mind The second thing which is Almost as important Is that you often have strings that are across multiple components So the string back for example again or cancel Clothes It is not only used in one component is used in many components And so we also said to Ourselves we want to still just translate clothes Once And then in every other component where it's used It will automatically be used And so when we go to JCB if you have a fresh install of JCB And you scroll down and your open language translations You see that there is no values there A same as if you opened languages there's also no values there If you want to have JCB Populate the translation the English strings So where does it get them what it gets them from your fields And from your side views And from Any other place either Your admin view or Hero Any other place where you use Translation strings In then it populates dynamically the language translation so you don't really ever need to click New To create any it creates it For you so the way to do that if you would go to the compiler You select the component that you would like to compile I need simply click compile and you need that do that only once how you can please clear that out again You don't need to use it Now if we go back to language translations Suddenly There's a whole bunch of things here and also tells you that it hasn't been translated and all So just that's quickly and we got I missed 200 49 strings here And like I said close will only be shown up once So It is with every other strain If we then open one of these You see that you cannot edit the English string now we've had request The people would like to edit the string but it doesn't really make sense because if the string is Being used In a Field How would we be able to know But their relationship here in his to change For example if you update a string here Now JCP needs to know In that field in needs to update the label for example There's no way for us to it Uno determine the at So uh basically change the string and it won't be useful Because it JCB on compilation Will deter will detect that this string doesn't exist Anel just crave it again To the way that you would change a string which is found here Is you need to go and change it in the decided The field where it was created Or the side view or the admin View And I mean in this case we know that this word Mo Is the components name right so if you wanna translate that string Oh sorry change that strain So for example I'll quickly demonstrate that I'm gonna change this demo to 2 hours Like that And then save and close Now I'll compile it again And just cleared out and then go back to our language translation And now You see the demo is gone because Demo is no longer being used anywhere Another component either so the system will automatically remove it If you go to the end of this string will see the new ones Have been added Seether So that's how you would Change a English string is you'd go back to where you said it And then from there haven't been change I'm gonna just change it back quickly And then compile it again Clear it out again Go back to language translations And you see that it's removed the other one and it's added to correct one back Now I'm gonna translate or I would like to translate only this one string And if I wanna do that You see that there's no language is available We decided to allow the languages to be set dynamically meaning That you would manually create them And use them as you like So there is an area called languages Youth click new here And then you'd give the language name and it's tag now the tag We've given you an example here But if you do not know how this should look There are ways for you to find out one of the easiest ways Is there actually just go to gym a Las translation area So if you go to community Data dot Org translations dot HTML And then you select I would say just use selective This one that's the newest And then you'll see there's a whole bunch of languages here Clicking on any of these Will take you down to that language And basically this is The little tag that you would be looking for So if you want to do for example Dutch Then this is the the one The the tag that you use You would use the Dutch as the name And then that Esther tag I'm gonna set up just for example I'm gonna setup Afrikaans Is my native language So Is it gonna use Afrikaans As the language we wanna create And obviously then this is the The tug And you can create any of the languages you want to use We might get some point at a few major languages here And ship it like that but Just that you know you could just create a language You Cannot create a translation for that language unless you've done this You must first create the language It is just the way it works Now we can go back and Let's take a string that Wood look different in Afrikaans So let's take also So now here if there's more components which the word author is used in It'll all be linked in here and it all be done automatically you wouldn't need to do any of that You will only really need to focus on this translation area so also in Afrikaans is Scriber Auto tier So will use the idea which is actually more correct And then Will you select the language for which that string belongs And then save and close Another simple as that From now on in any component Where the word author is used If The Afrikaans translation with relation to the other strings Is enough Dynamically add this language To the component And you would not need to translate it again Well this is all been the way it's been working up till now so this is none of this is new The area that is new He said you can actually export G-strings To a spreadsheet And then You can import them From the spreadsheet and it all dynamically be at it so I'm gonna just select a few strings here you don't need to select any of the already trans Slated strings But if you do it will also be used at it doesn't really matter I'm just gonna select a few And Click export data This will create a Excel Spreadsheet Which you can then save After open that spreadsheet and you see that it has a bunch ID is And then it has English It's got the The tug of the language And it's got the value that we already set So now I'm gonna set The value for these others in the spreadsheet So now you got your Language File back from your translators And they basically translated it This column Now you can have multiple language every every language will have its own column And Or do you need to ensure that this top header Is the language tag That's really what's important and that this language Is created and published in your system Do not let them change to English string When you import this file The system will look for the ID and the string To identify that this value exists If it doesn't exist it will simply ignore it So if you change also Even though the ID Remains the Same It will not find it and it will simply ignore this line On the way I'll demonstrate this is I'm just gonna change back to having to k's And Save this document And then let's go back and import it At import it is simple we just click on import data Then we select the file from our system Click upload file And it should dynamically map the columns in your spreadsheet To the Table columns so you would have Your language drinks if you got multiple language It should automatically map in If you are having multiple languages and you only one import for the one language Then all you need do is add this ignore the column next to the language as you do not want to m Report Ok and then you click continue And that is it you will now see That it has added translations Except for back Now At first it didn't actually had these so I had to quickly go and add it all fixed to the Ford I didn't realise that At the moment It actually would stop at the first failure And not import further But I've just fix that and shoot Within the next update this should be resolved Anyway Pointers Once you've imported it you'll see that it is added The translations to Those Strings And it's also mapped it to the correct language But back was not imported because the English string didn't actually correspond If we go back to our spreadsheet And fix this little error And in fact make a little tweak to What are the other strings Just for example sake And then go back to importing this file after Saving it of course Save So then import data Browse Nail see that back is been done And the other one that we also played with was disclosing new We added to the double T there So now you are able to export This language strings Translate the manner spreadsheet And easily import that spreadsheet Which word automatically update Your values here if you Have updated more than 50% of the end the English strings To a specific language It will automatically be added to your component You can change this percentage By going to options In JCB And then basically changing this Select the percentage any language should be translated before the system Should add the language to component during compilation So that means If more than 50% of your English strings have been translated It starts adding it to the component If not It will just ignore it Ok that is Giving you a QuickTime mistration of the new import export Option in translating The strings in your system And knowing that if you have translated any of these strings will only You need to do it once Any delay mummy be available to every other component that uses that field or that View And therefore these English strings Thanks for watching
