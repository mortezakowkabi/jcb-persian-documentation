# CUSTOM ADMIN VIEWS

Very similar to Site Views, Custom Admin Views has some nice features as well although some aspects in adding it to Component Builder is different. In the next video we will look at adding Site Views as well as Component Custom Admin Views to the component. As Sermon Distributor is not using Custom Admin Views yet, it has not been discussed but there is another component that can serve as a example called: Cost Benefit Projection [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m33s)  It's a tool that is used to show companies the cost benefits of intervention in certain diseases and causes in the company. [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m04s) In it what is called 'Company results', and 'Combined results'. It respectively used to display custom data in the back end of the component to certain people who has permission to view that data. In the component itself; click on 'Companies', an icon underneath each of these names of the companies can be seen.[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m36s)  There is a 'new' button at the top called 'Combined Results'. These buttons are dynamically added by Component Builder. In the next tutorial it is explained exactly how that is done. <<<<<<<<<<





### Component Builder Custom Admin View 

This is how a Custom Admin View will look.(See video) All this information that is displayed serves only as example. [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m07s) If 'ClientM' is opened, this large area is displayed where a lot of HTML and PHP can be placed. There is some custom buttons that may be added. All of this in the white area is simply done in the Custom View. There is a menu on the left side. All of this is done inside the custom area of the component.[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m44s) Which is now the custom admin view.(See video) It has different value sets, and from here can a edit button be added. Since it has been linked it to a specific client or company or one item in that list,  you can click on 'edit'.[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m10s) From here the companies data can be accessed and editted. The convenience is that if 'close' has been clicked, it opens again that exact result page. All the implementation that has been done is displayed there. [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m35s) That is how a Custom Admin View can look.

Returning to the Companies list and from there to the Dashboard and then take a look at Component Builder, and open 'Company Results'. On this page is the PHP and HTML and a lot of templates are directly loaded here. [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m05s) <<<<<<<<<<<<<




   

### Add Custom Button Sample

Then I have a custom button area where I can say yes. I want to add custom buttons. Then I click on custom buttons(add). You will see I have 'icons' that I can select, and [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m25s) the 'name' of the button, and 'controller method' which I would like to use, to make the button work. In this one(target controller method) I'm saying 'gotocompanies'. This one is 'editcompany'. Here I should say what kind of target are we looking at? Is this a  single, a list, or both? [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m52s) You can set that respectively, and then you click save. It only saves it to the form, and not to the database. We should have made that done, but this is the Joomla's way of implementing it. 

### Adding Script For The Controller Methods

Now you have to add in the php controller method, add scripting to respectively implement the buttons click method. [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m16s) You can also do that to the model. So in the controller you can add script, and then in the model add scripting which is called from the controller, if you want to separate your code a bit. If you're not going to be adding any script to the model, just add none with this two spaces// in front, otherwise it might scream at you that you did not add script there. As you can see the 'gotocompanies' is simply [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m47s) take you back to the companies view. Where as the 'editcompany' implements the Joomla's convention of opening an item to edit it by the correct channels. This is just Joomla knowledge at work here. And we are checking a token and all that. Component Builders sets of all the tokens and everything. [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m13s) This(see video) snippet you can reuse for your purposes if you want. 

### Area For Custom Scripting

We have an area for custom scripting and as you can expect. There's a lot of custom scripting going on in that view. It has its respective places, if you want to know where, what's happening at some snippet here, compile your components, search for that snippet, and you'll see where this comes up, if you're not certain by the naming conventions we have used. That is how you setup custom admin view. [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m51s) 

### Combining Multiple Data Example

To look at the other one, the combined results view. The combined results is this one up here, if you click it, It will tell you, we need to have some items selected. You select the items and click combined result again, and it will do a combined resolve taking both companies adding it's data together, [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m16s) and giving you a nice layout structure of it's data sets. That is the combined concept. If we go back to the implementation of it, it looks very similar as the other. Again just a lot of html and php here. Also some custom button, again just going back to companies. [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m41s) It's just same implementation, vcard companies, go back, single, and then some custom scripting. That's how I set up both of those custom views. Quite simply adding the data. Then making use of the templates as well as layout implementation in both of these. You can set up layouts and templates and use them in site views, you can also use them in admin views.  [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdQ1lwB9ds&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m11s) In our next tutorial we will look at how to add site views and admin views to your component since there are some differences and you need to be aware of them.
