Hi Welcome My name is Llewellyn van der Merwe I'm the developer of component builder for Joomla [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m10s) I would also be Giving you the instructions of how to use it Just wanna look at a few issues Component-Builder was built to those who know PHP If you don't know PHP there are some Great places to Start Learning from and one To those I would mention is [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m30s) Lynda.com And udemy You could go on to their websites and you can simply search for PHP And you would find tons of courses that I suppose would do more than enough to to get you on your way If you don't know CSS JavaScript HTML then certainly you need to go visit these website And get that knowledge It was not developed for those who [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m59s) Have no but developing skills Because Simply I developed it actually for myself As developer of components So that I can easily and quickly get Most of the bulk of the code done And I could just be focused on the actual custom Code which Goes beyond the norm So that's what it's really made [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m24s) To do If you don't have an understanding of the Joomla API It's only gonna be to your own Disadvantage It's not that difficult to get it understanding You just need to be able to read PHP And open a Joomla website go to libraries start reading with Classes Even go to Joomla's own components [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m49s) That means you would Simply Go to a Joomla install that's this one here And you go to components and you would go to Content manager Look at its folder structures then open obviously if you know cmv And there's the controllers there's the models there's the Views [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m12s) Open a view Start opening the script itself Read through it If using NetBeans You can hold onto a function like that one Press Ctrl shift It'll show you where In your Joomla website That function is declared And [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m34s) You can You can open that file And you can let's see I think you click there Open source in editor there we go And you can start By doing these kind of things You can start learning in the way that the code Connects to each other Through just looking at Joomla's own [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m58s) Components Basically that's how I got to know how things work I simply went here Helper content control shift and Then opened that in the next window Look through the Class Methods class variables Which ones that is extending [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m21s) This one isn't extending any So That's how I got to know how most things work And That's also how most other developers I suppose are able to get their hands on this And so the better you know the Joomla API To the more advantage to yourself Because you will understand that this application is really implementing the API itself over and over I didn't reinvent things I'm trying to stay as close to the conventions [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m55s) as possible And as I become aware of Better ways of implementation I would like to At that again So even if you know a better way to doing it Please communicate with me I would likely Updatening include and change [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m11s) Whatever is needed You must be willing to get your hands dirty it is not one of the issues that are quite important This simply means that if you have built something and it doesn't work You need to debug it Which means Possibly you would like to run a local Sandbox environment I'm running here on Ubuntu Is my local sandbox And so [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m38s) I have PHP on it and Got My sequel installed and Joomla So if I was to open a browser And I would type in this Local This is my local install so you can see I just typed in VDM [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m04s) And I have Basically a few sites here Test one is one we'll be working in And The one in which Component-Builder is being developed Is this Component Builder 1 And those sites have admin so this is just my own little Script that I've dumped onto my own little server And I can now [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m27s) Change that Say Ok Let's go to Builder dot VDM That's another Site And it's loading some of the Test [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m43s) Displays that I'm working on And I add Administrator do that Open the back end And I can login So I'm running in a Sandbox environment And what this The advantages as you don't have any internet Involvement those of you that already do it know all these advantages but those of you don't [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m07s) You you can basically work offline mostly And And as well you can add Things like XDbug And other script Which help you debug Your application very easily We doing that in online developing sorry Off-site environment is [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m26s) Time consuming and Difficult and Expensive So it's much easier doing it offline and again if you don't know how to do that Please visit Lynda.com and Look at a course called I think it was Up and running with PHP Linux developer Linux server Running my next Wait let me quickly go find out hold on Ok here we have it up and running with Linux for PHP developers by Jon Peck [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m59s) Is an excellent course to get your own Local Developing environment setup I don't know this URL is gonna be helpful But there it is Apache-tutorials up and running Linux PHP developers and I'm sure if you've watched this I've watched it [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m24s) Any Moons ago And it's been very helpful To get my Initials Sandbox setup Obviously since then And I suppose with yourself as well you'll find it you you get better And you find better ways But it's a good place to start [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m44s) Ok so that is about getting your hands dirty Component builder best place of Function of being functional is offline If you gonna do it online please realise that there might be security risks Especially when you've compiled An application It places it into your temporary folder which can be accessed From From anywhere Anyone can access your temporary folder on your [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m14s) Server Of your website So Yes you can delete the application from there in mediately with a button which are show you later But it is still I feel unsafe and the purpose of the application was Live in a developing environment where you have Joomla installed and where you can really test it intensly So I would still suggest it None the less you do it that way Ok now Finally we almost there [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m45s) Finish with the introduction since it's free please help me to ensure the future of this component By not sharing it's training videos online or with anyone else this is really the only way that I can sustain this Development is if you Don't share these videos so please if you be so kind If you have an organisation or you your a company and you have a Others that's gonna view it I suppose I can't stop you from doing that but I would encourage you there for then [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m28s) to consider making a contribution when you are starting to reap the benefits of The time that this application saves you so that this application can be further developed for the rest of the The community and also for yourself We would like to also involve you on Github so you can go to GitHub /VDM - IO / Joomla component builder Basically this place here And if you if you have issues or any requests or anything really Please come here and go to issues and open a new issue [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m12s) I want to be sure you can do that if you've got an account of course with GitHub And then we at least our discussions you are logged and it's public and others can see it and We can also come back as do it in reference If you want to make a feature request then you can start That feature request obviously herein the issues And possibly if it exist I'll point you out to it and if a training is needed we will add it to this training Video set but if there is a feature request that has started here and you feel that you you can't wait because we possibly will create milestones and we will add feature requests to milestones in you wanna ensure that a feature request ends up being done Before anyone else is then you need to communicate with me at this email and I can send you [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evJkBTnKxE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m09s) a link to to make a donation or a Yeah I'll give you an invoice even if needed so that we can ensure that feature request be done Before Others ok so that's maybe all of it just looking at sort of an introduction If you have any questions please let me know Obviously not regarding the component itself but just these points I've mentioned I'll be grateful ok It's so let's get on with it Since I'm really looking forward to showing you how everything works
