The directories, folders and files of the JCB Demo component, found in the JCB Demo installation package named com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip is presented here for your convenience. For simplicity, it is recommended you install only Joomla! and the JCB component without installing the demo component using the Joomla! installer. This allows you to focus on the following:

* JCB
* JCB Demo package
* JCB areas containing the Demo code
* JCB functionalities and features used while building the Demo component
* JCB interaction with the Joomla! API

This process will introduce you to a typical MVC directory structure and the files it contains for a component that is not complex. You will find most of it is common to all components, regardless of their complexity. Keep in mind as you progress through the videos and accompanying chapters in this manual plus the JCB components being discussed in them as examples, many of them freely distributed, that variations will occur and this structure will become more complex with many additional files as the complexity of the JCB and also your own components increases. However, they all share one thing in common which is the MVC paradigm; all follow its basic directory structure, including the locations of files in them, their naming conventions, and the structure of the code and necessary constructs you'll find applies to all Models, Views or Controllers required by them to function regardless of how simple or complex they are.

The last bullet above is extremely important to understand as we stated earlier in this manual. There will be directories, files and code in them you may ponder over with the JCB Demo and your own components; you will wonder how they got there. JCB leverages the Joomla! API to accomplish this. To see how this is done, go the extra mile and cross reference everything as was done here in your a text file. You can use a word processor to open this file and create similar tags. The process is extremely tedious, but it will reinforce your understanding of the many areas of JCB where the component's directories and files were created automatically by JCB. This includes the code snippets you have written and placed in various areas of the JCB component during the build process and then used some of JCB's standard features and functionality to enhance your code snippet but did not write any code for. This process also allows one to understand that JCB reuses and extends Joommla!'s core code supplied by the Joomla! API as much as possible.

Unzip com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip and using the shell or command line, list its directories, sub-directories and all the files contained in them, by changing to the root of the directory and typing for example dir > demoDirectory.txt /s if using the Microsoft Windows command line. Other operating systems have a similar command in their shell. Then, browse through the directories and files using the file manager for your operating system like Windows Explorer or better yet, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like NetBeans. An IDE is recommended since it has many features facilitating this analysis. Some of these include:

* A file manager to browse through the directory tree and files
* The ability to open one or several files at a time in separate windows
* Using the IDE to quickly locate base classes in the Joomla! API that are reused and extended by JCB
* Searching through the development site or file a list of where the search word occurs
* Many other tools in the IDE, and downloadable plugins to extend its capabilities
* Extensive debugging capabilities; NetBeans supports XDEBUG natively as one example
* Use of Chrome and its extensions to enhance the XDEBUG capabilities

Debugging aids are an essential part of any developer's IDE. Spending hours trying to locate a runtime bug by reading through hundreds and perhaps thousands of lines of code to find a single misplaced character for example is exasperating. Good debugging usually locates the offending line in minutes. It also may be used to facilitate your analysis and your development efforts. Some of the functionality offered by a good IDE debugger are:

* Single stepping through code while it executes
* Adding breakpoints and watches to suspend execution and examine contents of variables
* Stack traces that show the path of each script and resource used during execution
* Watches to examine the contents of variables based on their contents
* A dump of all variables in play while single stepping through the code
* Easily examining classes, methods, and properties including their source on the fly during execution

A good IDE has these and many other features and functionalities and is indispensable during the development cycle of a component. See the Appendix in this manual titled Debugging for examples of this and other features this IDE and others have to offer that enhance the JCB build process and allow you to quickly identify and resolve issues in your code when it compiles, but does not execute without errors. Also, make use of Joomla's! built in debugging enabled in it configuration settings. The stack trace it displays, including links if using XDEBUG, is also indispensable and works with an IDE like NetBeans using the Chrome NetBeans extension.

It should be mentioned for those wishing to take the quick path to browse com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip directly using Windows File Explorer as one example and skim through the tree and files. For some, this is all they require, especially if they are experienced PHP developers who are familiar with the Joomla! API and found JCB easy to understand. However, if you are not at this point yet, creating the text file and performing the same analysis done here for your own component or ones freely supplied by JCB, as some are complex, is an excellent exercise. Make notes in your text file as you browse through the directories and files on your development site for later review or revisiting concepts that perhaps were not very clear at the time. Follow along as you go through the directory tree on your system. Locate and open the files in each one shown below and view its contents. Good study habits will enable you to progress quickly to the experienced stage with the MVC paradignm, JCB and the Joomla! API.

Beneath the directory structure and files presented next you will find a short explanation of their relation to the component, the areas of the JCB component that builds each and JCB's interaction with the Joomla! API. You'll see how JCB reuses and extends Joomla!'s abstract base classes, including their methods and properties to implement the many features and functions built into JCB which are utilized by you while building a component. As you peruse the directory structure and files, links are available allowing you to quickly go to the explanatory text below the directory structure for that file, including a reference to where in JCB it originated from and any interaction between JCB and the Joomla! API.
