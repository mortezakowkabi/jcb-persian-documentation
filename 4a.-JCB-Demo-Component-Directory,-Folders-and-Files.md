The directories, folders and files of the JCB Demo component, found in the JCB Demo installation package named com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip is presented here for your convenience. For simplicity, it is recommended you install only Joomla! and the JCB component without installing the JCB Demo component using the Joomla! installer. This allows you to focus on the following:

* JCB
* JCB Demo package
* JCB areas containing the Demo code
* JCB functionalities and features used while building the Demo component
* JCB interaction with the Joomla! API

The last bullet above is extremely important to understand as we stated earlier in this manual. There will be directories, files and code in the files you may ponder over with the JCB Demo and your own components built using JCB; you will wonder how they got there. JCB leverages the Joomla! API to accomplish this. To see how this is done, go the extra mile and cross reference everything as was done here in your own text file. You can use a word processor to open this file and create similar tags. The process is extremely tedious, but it will reinforce your understanding of the many areas of JCB where the component's directories and files were created automatically by JCB. This includes the code snippets you have written and placed in various areas of the JCB component during the build process while using JCB's standard features and functionality to enhance your code snippet, but did not write any code for. This process also allows one to understand that JCB reuses and extends Joommla!'s core code classes, methods and properties supplied by the Joomla! API as much as possible.

The JCB Demo component analysis presented in this chapter will introduce you to a typical MVC directory structure and the files it contains for a component that is not too complex. However, the MVC paradigm applies to all components, regardless of complexity, whether built using JCB or using traditional coding methods that follow the MVC paradigm to the letter as JCB does. In fact, Microsoft Windows Notepad could be used as long as the MVC paradigm is strictly followed. But as the complexity increases, the indispensable nature of developing with the following greatly reduces the time required to build a component:

* A local development environment like WAMP with native XDEBUG capabilities
* Joomla! Component Builder
* NetBeans or a similar Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with native XDEBUG and GitHub functionality
* Chrome plus its Developer tools and developer extensions or, others like Firefox with similar features and add-ons
* Joomla! Debug, especially its Stack Trace, and XDEBUG compatibly including links to the source in each trace

There are many other possibilities, especially with the IDE, but this combination integrates well, and much of its features are native to the applications comprising it. This also applies to any other components used as examples in the videos and chapters accompanying them in this manual. Keep in mind as you progress through them the complexity of the components being shown as examples will increase. The directory tree will look more complex, and contain many additional files. However, they all share one thing in common which is the MVC paradigm; all follow its basic directory structure and naming conventions, including the files contained in it. This also includes the locations of the files. The code and necessary constructs specific to a Model, View or Controller for each to function and interconnect with each other at the and the Joomla! API at the most basic level are common to all Models, Views and Controllers in any component developed using the MVC paradigm in its strictest sense.

Unzip com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip and using the shell or command line, list its directories, sub-directories and all the files contained in them, by changing to the root of the directory and typing for example dir > demoDirectory.txt /s if using the Microsoft Windows command line. Other operating systems have a similar command in their shell. Then, browse through the directories and files using the file manager for your operating system like Windows Explorer or better yet, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like NetBeans. An IDE is recommended since it has many features facilitating this analysis. Some of these include:

* A file manager to browse through the directory tree and files
* The ability to open one or several files at a time in separate windows
* Using the IDE to quickly locate base classes in the Joomla! API that are reused and extended by JCB
* Searching through a development site or file to produce a list of all occurrences where the search word or phrase occurs
* Availability of many other tools in the IDE, including downloadable plugins to extend its capabilities
* Extensive debugging capabilities; NetBeans has native support for XDEBUG debugging and GitHub versioning
* Interaction with Chrome or Firefox browsers e.g. Chrome's NetBeans and XDEBUG extensions plus Firebug

Debugging tools are an essential part of any developer's IDE. Spending hours trying to locate a run-time bug by reading through hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines of code to find a single misplaced character is exasperating and non-productive. Good debugging skills usually allow one to locate the offending line or lines of code in minutes. It's usually easy to correct an issue, it's almost always difficult to find where it occurred, especially with all the interconnections one finds in a component using the MVC paradigm, much less ones using the Joomla! API extensively such as JCB does. It also may be used to facilitate your analysis and your development efforts. Some of the functionality offered by a good IDE debugger are:

* Single stepping through code while it executes
* Adding breakpoints and watches to suspend execution and examine contents of variables
* Stack traces that show the path of each script and resource used during execution
* Watches to examine the contents of variables based on their contents
* A dump of all variables in play while single stepping through the code
* Easily examining classes, methods, and properties including their source on the fly during execution

There are many other features and functionalities not mentioned here. Effective debugging is indispensable during the development cycle of a component. See the Appendix in this manual titled Debugging for examples of implementing these and other features a good IDE has to offer. It enhances the JCB build process and allows you to quickly identify and resolve issues in the component after JCB has compiled it successfully, but the component has run-time errors. Also, make use of Joomla's! built in debugging enabled in its configuration settings. The stack trace it displays, including links if using XDEBUG, is also indispensable. Plus, it integrates with an IDE like NetBeans using the Chrome NetBeans extension.

It should be mentioned for those wishing to take the quick path you can browse com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip directly using Windows File Explorer as one example and skim through the tree and files without extracting it. For some, this is all they require, especially if they are very experienced PHP developers, have used the Joomla! API extensively and found JCB was not very difficult to learn by just reading its code. However, if you are not at this point yet, creating the text file and performing the same analysis done here for your own component or ones freely supplied by JCB, as some are complex, is an excellent exercise. Make notes in your text file as you browse through the directories and files on your development site for later review or revisiting concepts that perhaps were not very clear at the time. Follow along as you go through the directory tree on your system. Locate and open the files in each one shown below and view its contents. Good study habits will enable you to progress quickly to become an advanced developer of components built using the MVC paradignm, JCB and the Joomla! API. Microsoft Notepad is not recommended by the way to accomplish this, despite your level of expertise. It, along with the other tools mentioned here, allows you to save a lot of time, develop more components and most importantly, adhere to the MVC paradigm which is a time-saver in itself.

Beneath the directory structure and files presented next you will find a short explanation of their relation to the component, the areas of the JCB component that builds each and JCB's interaction with the Joomla! API. You'll see how JCB reuses and extends Joomla!'s abstract base classes, including their methods and properties to implement the many features and functions built into JCB which are utilized by you while building a component. As you peruse the directory structure and files, links are available allowing you to quickly go to the explanatory text below the directory structure for that file, including a reference to where in JCB it originated from and any interaction between JCB and the Joomla! API.
