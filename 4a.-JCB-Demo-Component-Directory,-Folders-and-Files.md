The directories, folders and files of the JCB Demo component, found in the JCB Demo installation package named com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip are presented here for your convenience. Other topics are presented that will facilitate the process. For simplicity, it is recommended you install only Joomla! and the JCB component without installing the JCB Demo component using the Joomla! installer. This allows you to focus on the following:

* JCB
* JCB Demo package import
* JCB areas containing the Demo component code
* JCB functionalities and features used while building the Demo component
* JCB interaction with the Joomla! API

The last bullet above is extremely important to understand as we stated earlier in this manual. There will be directories, files and code in the JCB Demo component package you may ponder over; you will wonder how they got there. JCB leverages the Joomla! API to accomplish this. To see how this is done, go the extra mile and cross reference everything as was done here. The process is tedious, but will reinforce your understanding of the many areas of JCB where the component's directories and files were created automatically by JCB. This includes the code snippets you have written and placed in various areas of the JCB component during the build process while using JCB's standard features and functionality to enhance your code snippet, but did not write any code for. This process also allows one to understand that JCB reuses and extends Joommla!'s core code classes, methods and properties supplied by the Joomla! API as much as possible.

The JCB Demo component analysis presented in this chapter will introduce you to a typical MVC directory structure and the files it contains, for a component that should be easy to understand. However, the MVC paradigm applies to all components, regardless of complexity, so the analysis can be applied to any component. As the complexity increases, developing with the following greatly reduces the time required to build a component:

* A local development environment like [WAMP](http://wampserver.aviatechno.net/?lang=en&prerequis=afficher) with native [XDEBUG](https://xdebug.org/) capabilities
* Joomla! Component Builder
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) or a similar Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with native XDEBUG and GitHub functionality
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) plus its [Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) and [developer extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/ext/11-web-development) or, others like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with similar features and add-ons
* Joomla! Debug, especially its Stack Trace, and XDEBUG compatibly including links to the source in each trace

There are [many other possibilities](https://docs.joomla.org/Setting_up_your_workstation_for_web_development), especially with the IDE, but this combination integrates well, and much of its features are native to the applications comprising it. This also applies to any other components used as examples in the videos and chapters accompanying them in this manual. Keep in mind as you progress through them the complexity of the components being shown as examples will increase. The directory tree will look more complex, and contain many additional files. However, they all share one thing in common which is the [MVC Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller); all follow its basic directory structure and naming conventions, including the files contained in it. This also includes the locations of the files. The code and necessary constructs specific to a Model, View or Controller for each to function and interconnect with each other and the Joomla! API at the most basic level are common to all, if developed using the MVC paradigm in its strictest sense.

Unzip com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip and using the shell or command line, list its directories, sub-directories and all the files contained in them, by changing to the root of the directory and typing for example dir > demoDirectory.txt /s if using the Microsoft Windows command line. Other operating systems have a similar command in their shell. Then, browse through the directories and files using the file manager for your operating system like Windows Explorer or better yet, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) or a similar Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with native XDEBUG and GitHub functionality. An IDE is recommended since it has many features facilitating this analysis. Some of these include:

* A file manager to browse through the directory tree and files
* The ability to open one or several files at a time in separate windows
* Using the IDE to quickly locate base classes in the Joomla! API that are reused and extended by JCB
* Searching through a development site or file to produce a list of all occurrences where the search word or phrase occurs
* Availability of many other tools in the IDE, including [downloadable plugins](http://plugins.netbeans.org/) to extend its capabilities
* Extensive debugging capabilities; NetBeans has native support for [XDEBUG debugging](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/debugging.html) and [GitHub versioning](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html)
* [Interaction with Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netbeans-connector/hafdlehgocfcodbgjnpecfajgkeejnaa?hl=en) or Firefox browsers e.g. Chrome's NetBeans and XDEBUG extensions plus [Firebug Lite](https://getfirebug.com/releases/lite/chrome/)

Debugging tools are an essential part of any developer's IDE. Spending hours trying to locate a run-time bug by reading through hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines of code to find a single misplaced character is exasperating and non-productive. [Good debugging skills](https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_debug_your_code) usually allow one to locate the offending line or lines of code in minutes. It's usually easy to correct an issue, it's almost always difficult to find where it occurred, especially with all the interconnections one finds in a component using the MVC paradigm, much less ones using the Joomla! API extensively such as JCB does. It also may be used to facilitate your analysis and your development efforts. Some of the functionality offered by a good IDE debugger are:

* Single stepping through code while it executes
* Adding breakpoints and watches to suspend execution and examine contents of variables
* Stack traces that show the path of each script and resource used during execution
* Watches to examine the contents of variables based on their contents
* A dump of all variables in play while single stepping through the code
* Easily examining classes, methods, and properties including their source on the fly during execution

There are [many other features](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/debugging.html) and functionalities not mentioned here. Effective debugging is indispensable during the development cycle of a component. It enhances the JCB build process and allows you to quickly identify and resolve issues in the component after JCB has compiled it successfully, but the component has run-time errors. Also, make use of Joomla's! built in debugging enabled in its configuration settings. The stack trace it displays, including links if using XDEBUG, are also indispensable. Plus, it integrates with an IDE like NetBeans using the [Chrome NetBeans extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netbeans-connector/hafdlehgocfcodbgjnpecfajgkeejnaa?hl=en).

Getting XDEBUG to work with your browser and IDE can be a daunting task. [This guide](https://quantumwarp.com/kb/articles/87-netbeans/928-debugging-with-netbeans-xdebug-and-xampp-in-windows) and [another one](https://articlebin.michaelmilette.com/making-xdebug-work-with-netbeans-on-windows/) have excellent tips on using XDEBUG with NetBeans and other IDE's and include using it with a browser. They also have instructions on how to troubleshoot the default port it uses and how to differentiate if the default port (9000) used by XDEBUG is the issue such as it is blocked by your firewall and needs a rule to punch through it or the required lines in the php.ini aren't there or are incorrect, or some other reason. It is also recommended to use [this excellent tool](https://xdebug.org/wizard.php) as it creates the necessary php.ini lines you will need to replace what NetBeans puts there which is just a stub except for the line that loads the correct DLL. The two links before that one are for understanding XDEBUG and what must be done to install it properly plus excellent troubleshooting instructions. The php.ini lines both suggest are not needed usually so use the php.ini lines generated by the tool in the last link in this paragraph.

WAMP allows switching between 5.x and 7.x versions of PHP. To facilitate XDEBUG WAMP uses a different XDEBUG DLL in the php.ini that WAMP switches between when different PHP versions are used. WAMP current version allows switching between that last 5.x version and three 7.x versions. So, do not change what was installed by WAMP at the end of php.ini. Comment out all the lines underneath using a semicolon (;) in each php.ini used by WAMP for each PHP version it allows you to switch to which is very nice for let's say looking at latest Joomla! version, e.g Joomla! 4 alpha.

Not using the correct DLL is the most common error when using XDEBUG and WAMP sets this up correctly. The other error that is very common is not having the  [Visual C++ Packages](http://wampserver.aviatechno.net/?lang=en&prerequis=afficher) installed for the corresponding version of PHP that was compiled. Let WAMP do this for you. The previous link appears to be the best one to use for a comprehensive installation of WAMP that is a one-page-stop for everything you need. Since there are many versions of WAMP, although you should be using the current one, it will not hurt to install all of the Visual C++ Packages. It takes some time and you must install the 32 and 64 bit versions and I suggest doing it in date order starting with the earliest and ending with the latest. Read through the page completely so you install everything that is required. Follow all the recommendations that are also on the page.

You can install all of the Visual C++ Packages as you will have then have whatever version of the package is needed for whatever version you have of PHP. Do not worry that two are French. They work fine but you may need to be sure you click the OK button instead of Cancel as they are in French. Other than that all else on the page installs in English. The dependency the PHP version has with each Visual C++ Package version depends on the version of the Visual C++ Package that was used to compile the PHP version. Like anything worth the effort, do the work and read the information in the sites I have mentioned previously. Often, XDEBUG will work if you just install it and hope the installation took care of everything. Try doing that first and if everything works correctly you probably have the right Visual C++ Package installed and left php.ini as is. If you switch PHP versions and it stops working then you will need to ensure the environment is set up correctly for that version. But it seems like many have issues with it as they depended on the install to do everything, including their environment, despite switching to another version of PHP. XAMPP will install XDEBUG without much effort from you but WAMP is a much better environment to work in. The same applies for LAMP and MAMP. It is beyond the scope of this manual to go into Linux and Mac operating systems also but the same concepts apply and many of the links also refer to these operating systems.

It should be mentioned for those wishing to take the quick path you can browse com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip directly using Windows File Explorer as one example and skim through the tree and files without extracting it. However, this is a [Joomla! component install package](https://docs.joomla.org/File_Structure_and_Naming_Conventions) so it will not match the directory structure. If you are familiar with the Joomla! installation package requirements and structure this should not be a problem. For some, this is all they require, especially if they are very experienced PHP developers, have used the Joomla! API extensively and found JCB was not very difficult to learn by using the JCB Component Builder after it is installed, plus browsing through its code.

If you have not reached this level yet, creating the text file and performing the same analysis done here is an excellent exercise. Do the same for your own components and when ready, import the more complex JCB freely distributed components into JCB and do the same. Make notes in your text file as you browse through the directories and files on your development site for later review or revisiting concepts that perhaps were not very clear at the time. Follow along as you go through the directory tree on your system. Locate and open the files in each one shown below and view its contents. Good study habits will enable you to progress quickly to become an advanced developer of Joomla! components built using the MVC paradignm, JCB and the Joomla! API. It, along with the other tools mentioned here, allows you to save a lot of time, develop more components and most importantly, adhere to the [MVC paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) which is a time-saver in itself.

Beneath the directory structure and files presented next you will find a short explanation of their relation to the component, the areas of the JCB component that builds each and JCB's interaction with the Joomla! API. You'll see how JCB reuses and extends Joomla!'s abstract base classes, including their methods and properties to implement the many features and functions built into JCB which are utilized by you while building a component. As you peruse the directory structure and files, links are available allowing you to quickly go to the explanatory text below the directory structure for that file, including a reference to where in JCB it originated from and any interaction between JCB and the Joomla! API.
