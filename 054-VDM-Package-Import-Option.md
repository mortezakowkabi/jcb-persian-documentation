This VDM package option that has been put in place will be great news for those who have purchased some of the JCB packages, like the Advanced Demo Component and the Sermon Distributor Component.

[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m20s)

This is a demonstration of what had been done and also some suggestions for future changes in the import components area. An extra tab has been added by which paid or free components can easily be imported. [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m39s)  It is called the **VDM packages**.

 It will take a while to load it since it queries GitHub and checks and gets a list of all the latest packages.  If GitHub is updated it will automatically show the new packages. [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m01s)  At the moment Hello World and the Demo versions are free packages and we are planning to add some more. 

### If Sermon Distributor is Reset - Everything Gets Reset

[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m24s)

If you have already purchased the Sermon Distributor version, just select it. Since JCB is constantly improving and with it Sermon Distributor, we are making changes to Sermon Distributor and if you want to update yours or even if you have played with it and you want to reset it, but **remember if you have to reset it, it will reset everything including every field and even Field Types.** [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m52s) Do keep that in mind that if you install this package over the existing one, it will revert everything back, what is great though, is that Joomla keeps history. [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m07s) If you put your history on for the JCB component, you could take a step back to some of those areas.

### Install By Clicking Get Package - Read All Information That Is Given 

[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m22s) 

Select the package that you would like to install and then click on 'Get Package'. This will take a while as it is downloaded from GitHub. Please make sure to read all these things.  You should end up on the page which usually shows who created the package. If you do not have a key, you could click on this 'sermondistributor' link to buy the key, [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) or get it from any of the other packages as well, there is a link that says 'Buy Packages'. Here it will show the component that is being installed, SERMON DISTRIBUTOR 2.0.2 which is the latest version. You can add your key here. Then click 'Continue'.  Then it gets installed. 

### Quiet Switch Added

[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m28s)

We added this new switch here 'Quiet' . Some of your releases that might have a spelling mistake like this one here which is 'Quite'. It has been fixed and a fix for this had been pushed out. This 'typo' will be fixed in JCB 2.7.1. [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m50s)  This 'Quiet' switch gives the option to see exactly everything JCB does when a package gets imported. It shows what IDs were changed but it does not give you the names, only the ID references.  [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m19s)  Usually, it is set to quiet, so that you do not see all that detail except you would like to see if things had been done.

### Force Local Update - Overwrite Existing Data

[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m33s)

If you want to overwrite existing data the 'Force Local Update' may be used. If it finds an item and that item is newer than the one [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m48s) that is being imported then it drops the import option, and it keeps the newer version in your system. It usually worked like this when the Force Local Update had been clicked to 'No'. If you change it to 'Yes', then it will ignore the time stamp completely and update the item irrespective of whether it is newer or older or whatever. [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m15s) Add the ID and then  click 'Continue'. Now you will have a very detailed printout. It will indicate that it has been found, and then updates it. But if it is not found, it will say, that ID so and so, in a certain field was changed to ID so and so, and it has been imported. [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m44s)  There is quite a long list of everything it did and at the bottom, it says 'Great!' <<<<<<<<<< 

All of the rest [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s) we have showed you because we ticked it not to be Quiet. Sermon Distributor was imported. You can open it look at it. It's should have all the data here. The licensing might have changed. Let's just add another licence(vdm.txt) and then save and close. You can  compile it as easy as that. [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s) Sermon Distributor, click Compile, and then once it's compiled, then you have the Joomla package. What this does, it also includes the external script which is also a demonstration of the adding external scripts. It grabs it from GitHub. You can go and look at that. [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m54s) It is simply a script that checks for mime_types. It tells you that first time very detailed in there after you only see this (There has been 2 - code 'strings added to this component as EXTERNALCODE. To avoid shipping your component with malicious **code'strings** always make sure that the correct code'string values were used.).  Only if it changes will you see something like that again. You can click on install. If you go to components there it is Sermon Distributor fully mapped, [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) all functional. JCB has built this by importing it first from our GitHub repository. Then you're able to adapt it and use it in anywhere you like. That is the new feature I wanted to demonstrate. I hope you like it. 

### Suggestion - Community Tab

[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m39s)

What the suggestion is at the moment, we can  go back there for a moment to importing components. The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab. So there will be this tab VDM packages and then a Community tab. Which those of you in the community who want to share [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m04s) free components, we could add that in here. We are still thinking about the sharing paid components. We still think about how that could work. Of course at the moment it shouldn't become too complicated, because if you click on anything [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m28s) and then click Get Package, that package has internal variables which decides what this values going to Be. If we would [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m42s) click this googlePlusProfileFeed value, it takes you to my shop where you then purchase that specific product. That is a valued determined by the package. Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to include paid options, paid components. What is a little bit of a challenge, [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s) is whether JCB should ask for a little bit of a contribution to support a project in this way. We are still discussing that. 

If anyone have a suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the video, make comments, tell me what you think. The end of day we want to make sure that the community can use this [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m33s) in long run that it becomes a nice tool. I'm even thinking of moving this option, this whole getting to Importing of components, To an actual tab, On the desk on the dashboard. So you can get to this page without having to first go to components and then click through here. [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m54s) There is even that kind of discussion. But just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature. It's been able to do that already. We just didn't have that extra tab but you could have copied the links to those packages on GitHub and have imported them that way. That's should what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you purchase any of these keys.
