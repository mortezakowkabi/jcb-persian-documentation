[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)

Great news!

I think the option that we've put in place especially for those of you that have really purchase some JCB packages, like the Advanced Demo Component or the Sermon Distributor Component, this will be excellent news.

### Demonstration And Suggestions Of future Changes On Import Component Area

[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m20s)

Let me demonstrate what we've  done and also makes suggestions of future changes on the import components area 
there is an extra tab. With this tab you can easily import paid or free Components [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m39s) that we distribute. It's called the VDM packages. It took a moment to load it, it does take a while because at the moment it queries GitHub and checks and gets a list of all the latest packages. If we updated GitHub it will automatically show the new packages. [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m01s)  We will be adding more free options. We are planning to add some more free packages. At the moment there is only 2. Most of them are paid. You can buy any of these packages and use it in anyway you like. 

### Hello World And Demo Version Is For Free

[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m24s)

The Hello World is free and the Demo version is free. You could, yes you can get any of these and if you've already purchased Sermon Distributor version, you can just select it here. Because JCB is constantly improving and so Sermon Distributor is also improving. We are making changes to Sermon Distributor and if you want to update yours or even if you have played with it and you want to reset it, but know remember [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m52s) if you got a reset it, it will reset everything including every field and even Field Types. Do keep that in mind that if you install this package over the existing one, [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m07s) it will revert everything back, what is great though, is that Joomla keeps history. If you put your history on for the JCB component, so that means you could  take a step back and some of those areas if you want it. That's just a little side note. 

### Install By Clicking Get Package - Read All Information That Is Given

[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m22s)

You select the package you want to install and then click on Get Package. This will take a while as it's downloading it from GitHub. Please make sure to read all these things I didn't even go through that but [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m37s) you should read all of these packages, all that is written there. You should end up at the page which we usually would shows you who made the package. If you still didn't get the key, you could click on this 'sermondistributor' link to go buy the key, [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) and get it for any of the other packages as well or before getting here, there's a link that says buy packages, you could also click on those and then select the package you like. Here it'll show you the component that is being installed which is says is   [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m12s) SERMON DISTRIBUTOR 2.0.2 which is the latest version. You then add your key here. Which I will do in a moment and then click Continue. Which then makes it install. 

### Quiet Switch Added

[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m28s)

We added this new switch here Quiet. Some of your releases that might have a spelling mistake like this one here which is Quite. But we fixed it and we did push out the fix for this. Which means in JCB 2.7.1  [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m50s) we'll have this typo fixed. What this does, it give the option to see exactly everything it does. JCBs importing on the package. It tells you what ID was changed to what ID. It doesn't give you the names, it gives you ID references. It gives you a lot of more of insight of what happened. [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m19s) Which is used for when something doesn't go right, you could click on this. Usually it's set to quiet, you don't really want to see all that detail. You just want to know it's done, but if you want to see the details you can click yes. 

### Force Local Update - Overwrite Existing Data

[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m33s)

And here if you want to overwrite existing data. You will see how the Force Local Update works, if it finds an item and that item is newer then the one [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m48s) that is being imported then it drops the import option, and it keeps the newer version in your system. If you click here that's how it usually works with the Force Local Update to No, if you change it to Yes, then it will ignore the time stamp completely and update the item irrespective whether it is newer or older or whatever. [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m15s) We're add the ID and then we click Continue.  There you have it. It gave me a very detailed print out. When it found it, it says it was found, and then it updated it. But if it didn't find it, it will say, that ID so and so, in field was changed to ID so and so, and it's been [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m44s) imported. There is the list of everything he did. It's quite a long list. I'm scrolling and then at the bottom it says 'Great!' that's what you would usually see. 

All of the rest [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s) we have showed you because we ticked it not to be Quiet. Sermon Distributor was imported. You can open it look at it. It's should have all the data here. The licensing might have changed. Let's just add another licence(vdm.txt) and then save and close. You can  compile it as easy as that. [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s) Sermon Distributor, click Compile, and then once it's compiled, then you have the Joomla package. What this does, it also includes the external script which is also a demonstration of the adding external scripts. It grabs it from GitHub. You can go and look at that. [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m54s) It is simply a script that checks for mime_types. It tells you that first time very detailed in there after you only see this(There has been 2 - code 'strings added to this component as EXTERNALCODE. To avoid shipping your component with ????  .


 And only if it changes when will you see Something like that again Ok so you can click here on install And now if you go to components there it is Sermon Distributor Fully mapped [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) Well all functional JCB Has Built This by importing it first from our GitHub repository and then you're able to adapt it and Use it in Anywhere you like Anyway yeah that is the The new feature I wanted to sort of demonstrate I hope you like it What the suggestion is at the moment we can [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m44s) Just go back there for a moment Importing components The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab So there will be This tab VDM packages and then a Community tab like over here Which Those of you in the community Good one to share [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m04s) Free Components We could add that in here And we still thinking about the paid You know share sharing paid components Yeah we still think about how that could Work Of course at the moment it shouldn't become Too complicated because if you if you click on anything [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m28s) And then click get package That package It's has it Internal The variables Which actually decides the What this values going to Be right So if we would [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m42s) Click this value It takes you to my shop Where you then purchase that specific product Ok So That is a valued Determined by the package Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to actually include paid options paid components What is a little bit of a challenge [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s) Is whether JCB should actually ask for a little bit of a Yeah contribution To support a project in this Way so we still discussing that anyway anyone have a suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the Video make comments Tell me what you think The end of day We wanna make sure that the community can use this [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m33s) In long run that it becomes a nice tool I'm even thinking of moving this option this whole getting to Importing of components To an actual tab On the desk on the dashboard So you can get to this page without having to first go to Components and then Click through here [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m54s) So there is even that kind of discussion but just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature it's  It's actually been able to do that already We just didn't have that extra tab but you could have copied The links to those packages on GitHub and have imported them that way that's Should basically what what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you purchase any of these keys. Ok well thank for watching again. and speak to you again.
