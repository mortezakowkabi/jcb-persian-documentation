This VDM package option that has been put in place will be great news for those who have purchased some of the JCB packages, like the Advanced Demo Component or the Sermon Distributor Component.

### Demonstration And Suggestions Of future Changes On Import Component Area

[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m20s)

To demonstrate what had been done and also makes suggestions for future changes on the import components area 
there is an extra tab. With this tab paid or free Components that we distribute can easily be imported. [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m39s)  It is called the **VDM packages**. It will take a while to load it since it queries GitHub and checks and gets a list of all the latest packages.  If GitHub is updated it will automatically show the new packages. [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m01s)  At the moment there are two free packages and we are planning to add some more.

### Hello World And Demo Version Is For Free

[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m24s)

The Hello World and the Demo versions are free. You can get any of these and if you have purchased the Sermon Distributor version, just select it. Since JCB is constantly improving and with it Sermon Distributor, we are making changes to Sermon Distributor and if you want to update yours or even if you have played with it and you want to reset it, but **remember if you have to reset it, it will reset everything including every field and even Field Types.** [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m52s) Do keep that in mind that if you install this package over the existing one, it will revert everything back, what is great though, is that Joomla keeps history. [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m07s) If you put your history on for the JCB component, you could take a step back to some of those areas.

### Install By Clicking Get Package - Read All Information That Is Given 

[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m22s) 

Select the package that you would like to install and then click on 'Get Package'. This will take a while as it is downloaded from GitHub. Please make sure to read all these things.  You should end up on the page which usually shows who created the package. If you do not have a key, you could click on this 'sermondistributor' link to buy the key, [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) or get it from any of the other packages as well, there is a link that says 'Buy Packages'. Here it will show the component that is being installed, SERMON DISTRIBUTOR 2.0.2 which is the latest version. You can add your key here. Then click 'Continue'.  Then it gets installed. <<<<<<<<<<<

### Quiet Switch Added

[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m28s)

We added this new switch here Quiet. Some of your releases that might have a spelling mistake like this one here which is Quite. But we fixed it and we did push out the fix for this. Which means in JCB 2.7.1  [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m50s) we'll have this typo fixed. What this does, it give the option to see exactly everything it does. JCBs importing on the package. It tells you what ID was changed to what ID. It doesn't give you the names, it gives you ID references. It gives you a lot of more of insight of what happened. [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m19s) Which is used for when something doesn't go right, you could click on this. Usually it's set to quiet, you don't really want to see all that detail. You just want to know it's done, but if you want to see the details you can click yes. 

### Force Local Update - Overwrite Existing Data

[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m33s)

And here if you want to overwrite existing data. You will see how the Force Local Update works, if it finds an item and that item is newer then the one [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m48s) that is being imported then it drops the import option, and it keeps the newer version in your system. If you click here that's how it usually works with the Force Local Update to No, if you change it to Yes, then it will ignore the time stamp completely and update the item irrespective whether it is newer or older or whatever. [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m15s) We're add the ID and then we click Continue.  There you have it. It gave me a very detailed print out. When it found it, it says it was found, and then it updated it. But if it didn't find it, it will say, that ID so and so, in field was changed to ID so and so, and it's been [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m44s) imported. There is the list of everything he did. It's quite a long list. I'm scrolling and then at the bottom it says 'Great!' that's what you would usually see. 

All of the rest [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s) we have showed you because we ticked it not to be Quiet. Sermon Distributor was imported. You can open it look at it. It's should have all the data here. The licensing might have changed. Let's just add another licence(vdm.txt) and then save and close. You can  compile it as easy as that. [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s) Sermon Distributor, click Compile, and then once it's compiled, then you have the Joomla package. What this does, it also includes the external script which is also a demonstration of the adding external scripts. It grabs it from GitHub. You can go and look at that. [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m54s) It is simply a script that checks for mime_types. It tells you that first time very detailed in there after you only see this (There has been 2 - code 'strings added to this component as EXTERNALCODE. To avoid shipping your component with malicious **code'strings** always make sure that the correct code'string values were used.).  Only if it changes will you see something like that again. You can click on install. If you go to components there it is Sermon Distributor fully mapped, [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) all functional. JCB has built this by importing it first from our GitHub repository. Then you're able to adapt it and use it in anywhere you like. That is the new feature I wanted to demonstrate. I hope you like it. 

### Suggestion - Community Tab

[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m39s)

What the suggestion is at the moment, we can  go back there for a moment to importing components. The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab. So there will be this tab VDM packages and then a Community tab. Which those of you in the community who want to share [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m04s) free components, we could add that in here. We are still thinking about the sharing paid components. We still think about how that could work. Of course at the moment it shouldn't become too complicated, because if you click on anything [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m28s) and then click Get Package, that package has internal variables which decides what this values going to Be. If we would [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m42s) click this googlePlusProfileFeed value, it takes you to my shop where you then purchase that specific product. That is a valued determined by the package. Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to include paid options, paid components. What is a little bit of a challenge, [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s) is whether JCB should ask for a little bit of a contribution to support a project in this way. We are still discussing that. 

If anyone have a suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the video, make comments, tell me what you think. The end of day we want to make sure that the community can use this [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m33s) in long run that it becomes a nice tool. I'm even thinking of moving this option, this whole getting to Importing of components, To an actual tab, On the desk on the dashboard. So you can get to this page without having to first go to components and then click through here. [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m54s) There is even that kind of discussion. But just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature. It's been able to do that already. We just didn't have that extra tab but you could have copied the links to those packages on GitHub and have imported them that way. That's should what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you purchase any of these keys.
