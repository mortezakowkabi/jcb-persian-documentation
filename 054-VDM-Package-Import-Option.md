Import Paid or free Components That We ask Distribute It's called the wedding packages so it took of moment to load it it does take a while because Aquarius At the moment it queries GitHub And check and gets a list of all the latest packages So if we You know updated get up is all the matic Please show them the new packages Here So And we will be adding more free options Hi we are planning to to

reset it But I'll remember If you got a reset it it will reset everything in Including every field and even Fuel pipes So Do Keep that in mind That if you For this package Over the In 1 It will revert everything Back what is great though Is that Gmail obviously Tree right If you put your history on for the JCP component so that means you could actually take a step back and some of those ever If you want it Anyway that's just a little Side note so you basically select the package you want to install and then click on get package This will take a while as it's downloading it from get up please make sure to read all these things I didn't even know True that but Read All of these packages are fully you know that Is written there So you end up at the page which We usually would Shows you who made the package If you still didn't get it Tuk Click on this link here Taxi cab I take And I get it For any of the other packages Well Or before getting here there's a there's a link That says By packages you could also click on those in Like the bucket you like Here it'll show you the component that is actually being Stalled Zurich Distributor 2.0 2.0.2 Which is the latest version And You then add your key here Which I will do in a moment And then click continue Which then makes it Install We had a this new switch here quiet And some of your Riffs Releases that might be a spelling mistake like this This one here it is But we fixed it and We did push out The The Fixer For this Which means in JCB 7.11 Possibly 2.7 Oh so it was 7.1 Come on We'll have this type of fixed Anyway what does stars Is it give the option to see exactly everything it does they say busy Importing on the back So the actually tells you what it was changed to what ID It doesn't give you the names just give you ID references so gives you a lot of more Sort of inside of what happen Which is obviously used for when something doesn't go right you can click on this so usually it's set to quiet Really wanna see all that detail you just want to know it's done but if you wanna see the detail you basically Yes And here if you want to override Data See how the force location update works Is if it finds an item And that item is New Year Then the one That is Being imported then it Drops the import option And it keeps the newer version in your system So if you click here that's how usually works with the force local update to know No if you change this to Yes Then it will ignore the time stamp completely And update the item irrespective whether it is newer or older or whatever Ok so that's that So we're at the ID and then we click Continue on I'm gonna pause the video from home as you want to see the ID Do you have it So it gave me a very detailed Print out so when it didn't find when it founded It says it found it and then it updated But if it didn't find it it will actually say that I did so and so in field Was changed to ID so and so And it's been Imported so there is the list Of everything Did Yes quite a long list Scrolling Scrolling Ok and then the bottom it says great if that's what you would usually see Just that So All of the rest It actually just Showed you because Not to be quiet so now was SIM distributor imported Are you gonna open at look at it Basically it's Should have all the data here The licensing my Danger so just add another licence here and then Saving Close And then you can actually compile it as easy as that So similar to Beauty Decompile And Then once it's compiled obviously then you have the July package so what does does It also included the The external script with Is also the sort of it then Demonstration of The adding eggs So it's grabbing it from GitHub Simply script that text For my types And it tells you that first time very d Detailed in there after you lonely This And only if it changes will you see Something like that again Ok so you can click here on install And now if you go to components there it is some of those too Tubular Fully map Well all functional JCB Has Built This by importing it first from our get up repository and And then you're able to adapt it and Use it in Anywhere you like Anyway yeah that is the The new feature I wanted to sort of demonstrate I hope you like it What does the suggestion is at the moment we can do Just go back there for a moment Importing components The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab So there will be This tab VDM packages and then a Community tab Hi can we hear Which Those of you in the community Did want to share Free Components We could add that in here And we still thinking about the paid You know share sharing paid components Yeah we still think about how that could Work Of course at the moment it shouldn't become Too complicated because if you if you Trick on anything And then click get package That package It's has it in Internal The variables Which actually Besides the What does values Be right So if we Click this value It takes you to my shop Where you then purchase that Safic product Ok So That is a valued Determined by the package Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to actually include paid options faith components What is a little bit of a challenge Is whether JCB should actually ask for little bit of her Yeah contribution To support a project in Way I'm so we still discussing that anyway anyone have suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the Video make comments Tell me what you think The end of day You wanna make sure that the You can use this Long run that it becomes And I stool I'm even thinking of moving this option this whole getting to Importing of components To an actual tab On the desk From the dashboard So you can get to this page without having to first go to Components and then Click through here So there is even that kind of discussion but just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature it's Sir It's actually been able to Could do that already We just didn't have that extra w could have copied The links to those packages on I'm good up and have her imported them that way that's Shooter basic Clearwater what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you put it
