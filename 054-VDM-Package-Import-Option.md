O oh sorry 2.7.1 Come on We'll have this typo fixed Anyway what this does Is it give the option to see exactly everything it does JCBs Importing on the package So the actually tells you what ID was changed to what ID It doesn't give you the names just give you ID references so gives you a lot of more Sort of insight of what happened [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m19s) Which is obviously used for when something doesn't go right you could click on this so usually it's set to quiet you don't really wanna see all that detail you just want to know it's done but if you wanna see the detail you basically click yes And here if you want to overwrite existing Data You see how the force location update works Is if it finds an item And that item is Newer Then the one [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m48s) That is Being imported then it Drops the import option And it keeps the newer version in your system So if you click here that's how usually works with the force local update to No if you change this to Yes Then it will ignore the time stamp completely And update the item irrespective whether it is newer or older or whatever Ok so that's that [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m15s) So we're at the ID and then we click Continue I'm gonna pause the video from home as you want to see the ID And there you have it So it gave me a very detailed Print out so when it didn't find when it founded It says it founded and then it updated it But if it didn't find it it will actually say that ID so and so in field Was changed to ID so and so And it's been [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m44s) Imported so there is the list Of everything he Did Yeah it's quite a long list I'm Scrolling I'm Scrolling Ok and then the bottom it says great if that's what you would usually see Just that So All of The Rest [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s) It actually just Showed you because we ticked it Not to be quiet so now was Sermon Distributor imported Now you can open at look at it Basically it's Should have all the data here The licensing might have changed so just add another licence here and then Save and Close And then you can actually compile it as easy as that [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m28s) So Sermon Distributor click compile And Then once it's compiled obviously then you have the Joomla package so what this does It also included the The external script with Is also the sort of a Demonstration of actually The adding external scripts So it's grabbing it from GitHub.  You can go and look at that. [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m54s) It is simply a script that checks For mime types And it tells you that first time very Detailed in there after you only see This And only if it changes when will you see Something like that again Ok so you can click here on install And now if you go to components there it is Sermon Distributor Fully mapped [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) Well all functional JCB Has Built This by importing it first from our GitHub repository and then you're able to adapt it and Use it in Anywhere you like Anyway yeah that is the The new feature I wanted to sort of demonstrate I hope you like it What the suggestion is at the moment we can [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m44s) Just go back there for a moment Importing components The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab So there will be This tab VDM packages and then a Community tab like over here Which Those of you in the community Good one to share [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m04s) Free Components We could add that in here And we still thinking about the paid You know share sharing paid components Yeah we still think about how that could Work Of course at the moment it shouldn't become Too complicated because if you if you click on anything [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m28s) And then click get package That package It's has it Internal The variables Which actually decides the What this values going to Be right So if we would [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m42s) Click this value It takes you to my shop Where you then purchase that specific product Ok So That is a valued Determined by the package Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to actually include paid options paid components What is a little bit of a challenge [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s) Is whether JCB should actually ask for a little bit of a Yeah contribution To support a project in this Way so we still discussing that anyway anyone have a suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the Video make comments Tell me what you think The end of day We wanna make sure that the community can use this [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m33s) In long run that it becomes a nice tool I'm even thinking of moving this option this whole getting to Importing of components To an actual tab On the desk on the dashboard So you can get to this page without having to first go to Components and then Click through here [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHvawooT67s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m54s) So there is even that kind of discussion but just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature it's  It's actually been able to do that already We just didn't have that extra tab but you could have copied The links to those packages on GitHub and have imported them that way that's Should basically what what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you purchase any of these keys. Ok well thank for watching again. and speak to you again.
