# GLOBAL SETTINGS OF COMPONENT BUILDER

### Options Button For Global Configurations

Concerning the Options area of Component Builder.[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m19s) Open 'Component Builder Dashboard': It's accessible through the 'Options' button. Only users with permission will be able to see this button 'Options', if they are in a different group than that global administrator the 'Options' button will not be visible.[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s)   Those permissional structures can be changed as needed. Click on 'options' and this will open 'Component Builder configurations'. Here are some important switches. These areas(See video) could added to your own details if you would like to have it displayed in the components front-end. [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m13s)

### Check In Timer

Build into Component Builder is the option 'Check in timer' to check-in items. Here can be checked if an item has been locked out for 5 hours, it brings it back in, 12 hours, 24 hours, every second day , once a week, or never. The check in timer is set here(see video). [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m47s) 

### Enable Version

The version can be disabled by simply clicking 'no', or enable it by 'yes'. The quantity of versions which needs to be kept of the item may be set.  If '0' is set, all versions will be saved. It can be limited to prevent your system from being overloaded with data in the database. [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m17s)

### Minify JS(JavaScript) 

All the JS that have been built in Component Builder can be changed to be 'Minified'. [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m40s) While in production, components can be exported without minifying the JS in the files and in the footers of the documents. If minification becomes necessary, simply click 'yes', that would minify JS, which is your JavaScript in the component while it's being complied.  [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m07s)

### Contributor Info

You can add more contributors here and they will show up in the dashboard underneath contributors.[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m32s)  

### UiKit Settings

The UiKit settings is primarily for the back end , which at the moment is being implemented in certain areas. This is only needed most of the time in the front-end framework of the component. VDM has added it to Component Builder simply that if at some point it is decided to start adding a front end shop for the components that's being developed.[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) That's part of front end distributing software that possibly will be designed eventually. You could install this and then run it. It is like a factory with a front end. That is still in planning. As there might be some security risks, users are advised to use the Component Builder offline.
[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m35s)

### Encryption Settings 

Component Builder has a few places where it encrypts some of the data in the database. When Basic encryption is used the 'Basic Key' needs to be entered (See video). Once this key is entered, please ensure that you do not change it as this key locks the data and it is the only key that can unlock it.[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m13s) If this key is removed it cannot be unlocked. 

**NB. It may be removed to prevent unauthorized access to the data in those fields but then it must be saved in another place.** 

### Folder Paths

Currently there are two folder paths that can be used. It is the Backup folder path and the Git folder path.[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m42s)  Please read related notation. It is suggested that no changes should be made to Custom folder path and the Compiler folder path at this stage. These fields were added because VDM envisioned the possibility that these folders have to be moved out of our web area of developing, since it is part of some security concerns that this files and folders might be targeted. [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m14s) It has not been fully implemented all across the compiler infrastructure. Currently it's best to leave that folders the way they are by not adding any data in it. [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m50s) 

### Permissions

The permissional structure in Component Builder is not that intense, but there are a lot of permission switches. With the latest Joomla 3.5 release, this permissional structure updating construct is made much easier. A problem had been experienced in the past where the data set of permissions was to big and when it was saved, the browser got frozen and even the server did not want to receive the data set. [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) Now Ajax per field had been added, which makes this so much easier. That means that currently without clicking save and close, changes may be made to the permissional structure and immediately it will be stored in the data base. This apply to Joomla 3.5 and later versions. There is still these areas 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', 'Folder Paths' that we also want to store. [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m58s) Possibly this implementation isn't that accurate, but here is 'Configure Options Only' as a permission. Perhaps it will work by taking a certain group, give them that Configure Options Only 'Access', and then log out of this user. Login to a user that is in that group. Then this permissional tab will not be visible. [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m26s) Only these 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', 'Folder Paths' settings which are in these tabs will be seen. Changes may be made to these and saved without any browser latency or overload. Whereas it is possible to come in and tweak the permissions in Global or Super Administrator accordingly.  This can be changed in the manager area in the 'Select a new setting' column and it does a Ajax storing of the value in the database.[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) There are Global Create, Delete, Edit, Edit state, Edit own, Edit created by, and Edit created date. [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m39s) Then there is the per View permission structure like Admin view, Custom admin view, the Dynamic get, and have different areas where permissions can be changed for groups.

### Example Preacher Permissions

[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m05s)The same permission implementation options and structures are available to all components build by Component Builder, as the switches are used for the fields as well as for certain views.  In Components, [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m30s) Sermon Distributor, in the Admin Views is 'Access control'. There is another place of implementation. In Admin views, in 'Preacher', [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m28s) there is the permissional structure for 'edit'. If 'view' is selected , it is going to use the view name. If 'Core' is selected , it will fall back on the Core edit and delete features corresponding. If the word 'view.edit'is used an edit switch with this views name 'preacher.edit' will be seen in the permissional structure.  [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m51s)   If the word core.edit is used, only 'edit' or 'delete' or 'create' may be seen whatever one of these are selected. This in relation to each record means that it will be added to the record itself. The edit structure can be tweaked. This is only the global setting or this is for both. That is partly how some of the permissional switches are controlled. The other area is in fields itself. [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m25s) 

### Field Permission Switch

For example: In the specific field, 'Preacher name', a 'who edit?' switch can be used to prevent anyone to edit that field. Currently a 'who can view?' function had not yet being implemented since there are problems with a tremendous overload of switches being added to the permissional structure. Since Joomla has made this change it might possibly be added. [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m58s) This is how you get a fields permissional switch.

   **Example See Video **

[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m23s) For example: In the 'Fields' column click 'Name'. In the 'Permissions' column click the 'yes' switch', then save and close. Here is Sermon Distributor Dashboard open. Open it's options. Go to the permissional tab. Then scroll down. The Help Documents can be seen. Here is 'Preacher'.[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m49s) Preacher has site access and access to Preacher itself, and batch, create,  dashboard add, dashboard list, delete, edit, edit created by, edit created date, edit own, edit state, edit version, export, import, submenu, and then it starts with series. So as it doesn't show 'name' here yet. Go back to Component Builder, go to Compiler, and select Sermon Distributor, and compile it. Once it's completed, click on the 'Install' button to do a quick install. [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m27s) If that is completed go back to the configuration and refresh the page. Click refresh at the top. Scroll down and there is a new field 'Preacher edit name'. It can be decided, can this group edit that name or is it denied or should it be inherited? So the permissional structure per field can be added in this way.  Go back and revert that if you do not want that area to be monitored. [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m07s) Go back and open 'Preacher'. Back to the fields. Click 'no'. Save and close. Open Compiler. Select Sermon Distributor, compile it and install it. Go back to refresh. It can be seen that the field is gone. It's no longer being controlled by the permissional infrastructure.[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<




v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m41s)  That is how you can tell which group is able to access which fields. Even in which views are accessible through the permissional structures. This is an amazing advantage of component builder in its ability to integrate the permissions, not only per view, but also [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m07s) per field in a view. Your normal control also related to a specific view. Not only that, it also adds these permissions to every item. So you could override an item, and say ok this item I don't want that group to actually access this field. This is one of the advantages that component builder has above other similar applications out there. Its ability to implement some of the most advanced concepts that are currently accessed or available at Joomla. [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m50s) That's a quick look at the global configuration options for component builder.
