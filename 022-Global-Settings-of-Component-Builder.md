Hi They would like to look At Component builders Options Or what we would call Global settings Night possibly through the Tutorials have From time to time touched on certain areas Now we would like to give them all Precise look at The options area of Builder It's accessible through the options button And if you have to Permissions you will see this button Open it Permissions By that I mean certain users may not see this button if they are in it A different group than that Global admin Straighter And You can change those promotional structure is as needed So you click on options All open The component builder configurations or global settings as it's often referred to Your options or settings And there are number of switches here that is worth knowing about These areas here you could add your own details if you would like to Ever displayed In the components front-end Then there is a switch here checking timer We build into component dollar the option to check in the items Every so often And here you can check If it has been locked out for 5 hours it brings it back in 12 hours 24 hours Every second day once a week or never So the check-in timer is set here And you can change it to whatever is best suited to your system Done in Egypt enable in virgin Version control Is what this area is all about You can disable it by simply saying no Or enable it by yes And then you can say how many Virgins should be kept of the item If 0 all all versions will be saved so 0 means Everything And so you can Limited To sort of prevent your system from Are being overloaded with data Then You have many fights as Feature Basically all the JSE that is being built In a component Builder Can be Changed to be minified So Why urine production You can export your components Without minifying with j s In the files and in the photos of the of the documents But the moment you feel that you've reached The place where medication is necessary and you want to use it Then you'd simply trip the switch here And that would mean if I the Joyous which is your JavaScript In the component While it's being Ok And then just some details my wife Being very involved Discussing Osisa Java Developer And Helping me look at some of the implementations As well as my own details And like I said you can add more contribute is here and they will show up And the dashboard underneath contrib Then the you Kit Uikit settings This is primarily for the bakkie that the moment being implemented in certain areas But this is only really need it most of the time and the front-end framework Of your proponent So I've added it to component builder simply soda There If I At some point decide to start adding I found in shop for the components that's being developed That's part of 40 possibly would design eventually is a front end Distributing Software That was built by component Builder So you could install this and Then run it from your Factory with a front end basically And that is still in planning We still looking at some of the security risk since so far we've been carrying people to use the Important offline and not online So we not even sure how this will work possibly we might end up with two core Components ok then the encryption settings component builder has a few places where it is Some of the data in the database And we are using a basic encryption which means we are using this key that you enter here Once you've entered this key I think because it ships without a key and that So it looks like that So once you've entered the key Please ensure that you don't change it Because Diski is what Locks the data and it's the only key that can unlock it So if you remove this key you cannot unlock it so you could remove it if you wanted to Prevent people from knowing the data in those fields But then you need to save it somewhere else because if you don't have it Then you can't retrieve the data And decrypt it Ok The next up his folder paths Before the pass There are two for the fans that you're ready can make use of the backup folder in the get folder path Please read related Notation here Where is the custom folder path in the compiler for the path I would suggested the states that you don't make any changes to them I added this fuse because I envisioned the possibility that we want to move these folders Out of our Web Area of developing Since these are part of the security Concerns we have That these files and his folders might be targeted But I haven't fully implemented this all cross the compiler infrastructure So currently it's best to leave that That folders the way they are by not adding any data in here Sorry I clicked on the back button there anyway Said by just leaving this field blank We ensure that The Next time we can look at the missions Not a permission of structure and component Builder Is not that intense But as you can see there are a lot of commission switches What's the latest Joomla release of Joomla 3.5 This promotional structure updating construct is made much easier In the past We had a problem Weird that I said of your permissions is so big That when you save it it just freezes up your browser and even the server doesn't wanna receive Now they have added Ajax per field Which makes this so much easier That means that currently Without clicking save and close You can make changes to the promotional structure and that him Immediately will be stored to the ladder base That's from version 3.5 jumilla Now How would that be a see we still have these areas that we also want to store So What what what I have fought might work Possibly my implementation isn't that accurate Bye You have your configurations only as a permission so I would say take a Certain group Give them that configuration only Access And then Log out Of this user login to a user that is in that group Then this permission or tab won't show No only see the settings And a witches are in these tabs right And so they can make changes to these and save them without any Browser latency world Overload Where is you can come in and you can just tweak the permissions when you are in the global or super administrate So you can come in here and you can tweak the permissions accordingly So as you so previously What I was hearing the manager area I could just changed Change this and it doesn't Ajax storing of the value in the database Which is really smart I am very grateful that there done that Search for the main reason that this this set of the Remissions Became so use That I did some places had to do server adjustments on some of my components To to ensure that the user could still save and change the permissions Now So you have your You're a global create delete edit edit State edit own Edit created by and edit created date And then you get The Earth View Commission structure So here is the admin view then the custom admin view the dynamic get And they all have their own Different areas that you can change permissions Four groups to be able to do this or that The same permission implementation Options and Structures Are available to all components built by component Builder As you strip the switches for the fields as well as For your Certain Views Let me just go out of this to show you Components Then first be look at Bonus Salmon distributor Yeah In the oven views You have you and This access control But this is not the only place of implementation So close If you go to the admin views And let's say we open Preacher You have the permission of structure year Edit Navy select view is gonna use the view name if you select core Look for back on the core edit And Delete Features corresponding Sorry if you use the word View View data Use in the permission of structure and edit Switch with this views name preacher dot edit Where is you use the word Core data that you would only see Edit or delete or create whatever Select And this in relation to its record means that it will be added To the record itself you can tweak the edit structure This is only the global setting or this is for both And so that is party how you control some of the commissioner switches we just looked at The other area is in field itself You have your a promotional structure Where you can say ok this specific field let's say the preacher name I wanna control that permission who can edit it Is what you would add Edit button Currently we are not yet implementing who can View Since we were having problems with Tremendous overload of Switch is being added to the promotional structure What is Zuma's now made the strange we might possibly add that in Then you can't even have a View who can view that That field Where is this is currently just who can edit Ok So this is the house you get a Fields promotional switch Now Let me give you this is an example Let's make that one for now Name Say that it must be permission Save and close Save and close Here I have some in this to be to open so open it's options Go to his permission or tab Then scroll down And I see first years the help documents And here's preacher And preacher has side access and an access to preach itself And batch create Dashboard add dashboard list delete edit Any created by educated date Edit own edit State edit version Export import submenu and then it starts with series So as you can see it doesn't show name here yet So what we'll do is now will go back to component builder go to compiler And we will select somin distributor And compile it Wanted completed I'll just click on the install button here To do a quick install No that's completed let's go back to the configuration and just refresh The page I'll just click on the refresh rate It Off Now if we scroll down again it we'll get here we said See it got a new field here called preacher edit name and how I can decide Can this group edit that name or is it denied or should it be inherited So the promotion or structure perfume can be added in this way I'm gonna go back and revert that Because I actually don't want I don't want that area to be monitored So go back Open preacher Back to the Fields Say no Close compiler Select similar compiling it Then installing it Going back refresh And we see that the fuel is gone So it's no longer being controlled by this permission Infrastructure And so that is how you can Tell which Group is able to access which fields And even a witch Views are accessible Through the permission of structures This is an amazing advantage of component builder in its ability to integrate the Permissions not only per View But also Per Field in a view And your normal control also related to a specific view and I'll only that it Also adds these permissions to every item So you could override an item And say ok this item I don't want that group to actually access this field And this is one of the advantages that component Builder Has above other Similar applications out there It's it's ability to implement some of the most advanced concepts that are currently access Bowling Ok so that's a quick look at the Global configuration options 4 component Builder Thank you for watching
