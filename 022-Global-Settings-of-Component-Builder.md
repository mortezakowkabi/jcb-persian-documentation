# GLOBAL SETTINGS OF COMPONENT BUILDER

Hi. Today we would like to look at component builders options or what we would call global settings. Now I possibly through the tutorials have from time to time touched on certain areas. 

### Options Button For Global Configurations

Now we would like to give a more [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m19s) precise look at the options area of Component Builder. It's accessible through the options button. If you have the permissions, you'll see this button(options) and I can open it. The permissions, by that I mean certain users may not see this button(options), if they are in a different group than that global [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s) administrator. You can change those permissional structures as needed. So you click on options and this will open 'the component builder configurations' or global settings, as often referred to, or options or settings. And there are number of switches here that is worth knowing about. These areas here you could add your own details if you would like to have it displayed [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m13s) in the components front-end. 

### Check In Timer

Then there is a switch here at check in timer. We build it into component builder the option to check in the items every so often. And here you can check if an item have been locked out for 5 hours, it brings it back in, 12 hours, 24 hours, every second day, once a week, or never. The check in timer is set here. And you can change it to whatever is best suited to your system [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m47s) And then enabling version Version control Is what this area is all about You can disable it by simply saying no Or enable it by yes And then you can say how many Versions should be kept of the item If 0 all all versions will be saved so 0 means Everything And so you can Limit it [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m17s) To sort of prevent your system from of being overloaded with data in the database Then You have minify JS Feature Basically all the JS that is being built In a component Builder Can be Changed to be minified So [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m40s) Why you are in production You can export your components Without minifying the j s In the files and in the footers of the of the documents But the moment you feel that you've reached The place where minification is necessary and you want to use it Then you'd simply trip the switch here And that would minify JS which is your JavaScript In the component [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m07s) While it's being complied Ok And then just some details my wife Being very involved in Discussing She is a Java Developer And Helping me look at some of the implementations As well as my own details And like I said you can add more contributors here and they will show up [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m32s) in the dashboard underneath contributors Then the UiKit settings This is primarily for the backend at the moment being implemented in certain areas But this is only really needed most of the time and the front-end framework Of your component So I've added it to component builder simply so that There If I [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) At some point decide to start adding a front end shop for the components that's being developed That's part of what we possibly would design eventually is a front end Distributing Software That was built by component Builder So you could install this and Then run it from your It's Like factory with a front end basically That is still in planning We still looking at some of the security risks since so far we've been encouraging people to use the [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m35s) Component builder offline and not online So we not even sure how this will work possibly we might end up with two Components ok then the encryption settings component builder has a few places where it encrypts Some of the data in the database And we are using a basic encryption which means we are using this key that you enter here Once you've entered this key I think because it shifts without a key in it So look like that So once you've entered the key Please ensure that you don't change it [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m13s) Because This key is what Locks the data and it's the only key that can unlock it So if you remove this key you cannot unlock it so you could remove it if you wanted to Prevent people from knowing the data in those fields But then you need to save it somewhere else because if you don't have it Then you can't retrieve the data And decrypt it Ok The next up his folder paths [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m42s) . There are two folder paths that you already can make use of the backup folder and the get folder path Please read related Notation here Where is the custom folder path in the compiler folder path I would suggest at this stage that you don't make any changes to them I added these fields because I envisioned the possibility that we want to move these folders Out of our Web Area of developing [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m14s) Since these are part of the security Concerns we have That these files and his folders might be targeted But I haven't fully implemented this all cross the compiler infrastructure So currently it's best to leave that folders the way they are by not adding any data in here Sorry I clicked on the back button there anyway Said by just leaving this fields blank We ensure that The [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m50s) Next type we can look at the permissions Now the permisional structure in component Builder Is not that intense But as you can see there are a lot of permission switches With the latest Joomla release of Joomla 3.5 This permissional structure updating construct is made much easier In the past We had a problem Were the data set of your permissions is so big That when you save it it just freezes up your browser and even the server doesn't wanna receive the data set it's to big [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) Now they have added Ajax per field Which makes this so much easier That means that currently Without clicking save and close You can make changes to the permissional structure and that Immediately will be stored to the data base That's from version 3.5 Joomla Now How would that be a see we still have these areas that we also want to store So What I have thought might work [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m58s) Possibly my implementation isn't that accurate But You have here configurations only as a permission so I would say take a Certain group Give them that configuration only Access And then Log out Of this user login to a user that is in that group Then this permissional or tab won't show [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m26s) they will only see the settings And which are in these tabs right And so they can make changes to these and save them without any Browser latency or Overload Where is you can come in and you can just tweak the permissions when you are in the global or super administrate So you can come in here and you can tweak the permissions accordingly So as you saw previously What I was here the manager area I could just changed Change this and it does a Ajax storing of the value in the database [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) Which is really smart I am very grateful that they've done that Search for the main reason that this this set of the Remissions Became so huge That I had in some places had to do server adjustments on some of my components To to ensure that the user could still save and change the permissions Now So you have your You're a global create delete edit edit State edit own Edit created by and edit created date [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m39s) And then you get The per View permission structure So here is the admin view then the custom admin view the dynamic get And they all have their own Different areas that you can change permissions Four groups to be able to do this or that The same permission implementation Options and [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m05s) Structures Are available to all components built by component Builder As you trip the switches for the fields as well as For your Certain Views Let me just go out of this to show you Components Then first be look at components [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m30s) Sermon distributor here In the admin views You have here This access control But this is not the only place of implementation save and close If you go to the admin views And let's say we open Preacher [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m28s) You have the permissional structure here Edit Now if select view is gonna use the view name if you select core you will fall back on the core edit And Delete Features corresponding So if you use the word View View dot edit you will see in the permissional structure and edit [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m51s) Switch with this views name preacher dot edit Where as you use the word Core dot edit that you would only see Edit or delete or create whatever Select And this in relation to its record means that it will be added To the record itself you can tweak the edit structure This is only the global setting or this is for both And so that is party how you control some of the permissional switches we just looked at The other area is in fields itself [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m25s) You have your a permissional structure Where you can say ok this specific field let say the preacher name I wanna control that permission who can edit it Is what you would add who Edit button Currently we are not yet implementing who can View Since we were having problems with Tremendous overload of Switches being added to the permissional structure Joomla now made this change we might possibly add that in [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m58s) Then you can't even have a View who can view that That field Where is this is currently just who can edit it Ok So this is how you get a Fields permissional switch Now Let me give you this is an example Let's make that one for now Name [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m23s) Say that it must be permission Save and close Save and close Here I have sermon distributer open so I will open it's options Go to his permissional tab Then scroll down And I see first here is the help documents And here's preacher And preacher has side access and an access to preacher itself And batch create [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m49s) Dashboard add dashboard list delete edit edit created by edit created date Edit own edit State edit version Export import submenu and then it starts with series So as you can see it doesn't show name here yet So what we'll do is now will go back to component builder go to compiler And we will select sermon distributor And compile it Wanted completed I'll just click on the install button here To do a quick install [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m27s) Now that that is completed let's go back to the configuration and just refresh The page I'll just click on the refresh here at the top Now if we scroll down again it we'll get here we said See it got a new field here called preacher edit name and how I can decide Can this group edit that name or is it denied or should it be inherited So the permission or structure per field can be added in this way I'm gonna go back and revert that Because I actually don't want I don't want that area to be monitored So go back [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m07s) Open preacher Back to the Fields Say no Close compiler Select sermon distributer compiling it Then installing it Going back refresh And we see that the field is gone So it's no longer being controlled by this permission [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m41s) Infrastructure And so that is how you can Tell which Group is able to access which fields And even a which Views are accessible Through the permissional of structures This is an amazing advantage of component builder in its ability to integrate the Permissions not only per view But also [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m07s) Per Field in a view And your normal control also related to a specific view and not only that it Also adds these permissions to every item So you could override an item And say ok this item I don't want that group to actually access this field And this is one of the advantages that component Builder Has above other Similar applications out there It's it's ability to implement some of the most advanced concepts that are currently accessed [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m50s) Ok so that's a quick look at the Global configuration options for component Builder Thank you for watching
