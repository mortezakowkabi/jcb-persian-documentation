# GLOBAL SETTINGS OF COMPONENT BUILDER

### Options Button For Global Configurations

Concerning the Options area of Component Builder.[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m19s) Open 'Component Builder Dashboard': It's accessible through the 'Options' button. Only users with permission will be able to see this button 'Options', if they are in a different group than that global administrator the 'Options' button will not be visible.[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s)   Those permissional structures can be changed as needed. Click on 'options' and this will open 'Component Builder configurations'. Here are some important switches. These areas(See video) could added to your own details if you would like to have it displayed in the components front-end. [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m13s)

### Check In Timer

Build into Component Builder is the option 'Check in timer' to check-in items. Here can be checked if an item has been locked out for 5 hours, it brings it back in, 12 hours, 24 hours, every second day , once a week, or never. The check in timer is set here(see video). [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m47s) 

### Enable Version

The version can be disabled by simply clicking 'no', or enable it by 'yes'. The quantity of versions which needs to be kept of the item may be set.  If '0' is set, all versions will be saved. It can be limited to prevent your system from being overloaded with data in the database. [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m17s)

### Minify JS(JavaScript) 

All the JS that have been built in Component Builder can be changed to be 'Minified'. [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m40s) While in production, components can be exported without minifying the JS in the files and in the footers of the documents. If minification becomes necessary, simply click 'yes', that would minify JS, which is your JavaScript in the component while it's being complied.  [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m07s)

### Contributor Info

You can add more contributors here and they will show up in the dashboard underneath contributors.[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m32s)  

### UiKit Settings

The UiKit settings is primarily for the back end , which at the moment is being implemented in certain areas. This is only needed most of the time in the front-end framework of the component. VDM has added it to Component Builder simply that if at some point it is decided to start adding a front end shop for the components that's being developed.[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) That's part of front end distributing software that possibly will be designed eventually. You could install this and then run it. It is like a factory with a front end. That is still in planning. As there might be some security risks, users are advised to use the Component Builder offline.
[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m35s)

### Encryption Settings 

Component Builder has a few places where it encrypts some of the data in the database. When Basic encryption is used the 'Basic Key' needs to be entered (See video). Once this key is entered, please ensure that you do not change it as this key locks the data and it is the only key that can unlock it.[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m13s) If this key is removed it cannot be unlocked. 

**NB. It may be removed to prevent unauthorized access to the data in those fields but then it must be saved in another place.** 

### Folder Paths

Currently there are two folder paths that can be used. It is the Backup folder path and the Git folder path.[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m42s)  Please read related notation. It is suggested that no changes should be made to Custom folder path and the Compiler folder path at this stage. These fields were added because VDM envisioned the possibility that these folders have to be moved out of our web area of developing, since it is part of some security concerns that this files and folders might be targeted. [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m14s) It has not been fully implemented all across the compiler infrastructure. Currently it's best to leave that folders the way they are by not adding any data in it. [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m50s) 

### Permissions

The permissional structure in Component Builder is not that intense, but there are a lot of permission switches. With the latest Joomla release of Joomla 3.5, this permissional structure updating construct is made much easier. A problem had been experienced in the past where the data set of permissions was to big and when it was saved, the browser got frozen and even the server did not want to receive the data set. [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) Now ajax per field had been added, which makes this so much easier. That means that currently without clicking save and close, changes may be made to the permissional structure and immediately it will be stored in the data base. This apply to version 3.5 Joomla and later versions. There is still these areas 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', 'Folder Paths' that we also want to store. [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m58s) Possibly this implementation isn't that accurate, but here is 'Configure Options Only' as a permission. Perhaps it will work by taking a certain group, give them that Configure Options Only 'Access', and then log out of this user. Login to a user that is in that group. Then this permissional tab will not be visible. [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m26s) Only these 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', 'Folder Paths' settings which are in these tabs will be seen. Changes may be made to these and saved without any browser latency or overload.<<<<<<<<<<< 


  Whereas it is possible to come in and tweak the permissions in Global or Super Administrator. So you can come in here and you can tweak the permissions accordingly. So as you saw previously, when I was here in the manager area, I could just change this and it does a ajax storing of the value in the database. [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) Which is really smart. I am very grateful that they've done that search for the main reason that this set of the permissions became so huge, that I had in some places had to do server adjustments on some of my components to ensure that the user could still save and change the permissions. You have your global create, delete, edit, edit state, edit own, edit created by, and edit created date. [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m39s) Then you get the per view permission structure. Here is the admin view then the custom admin view, the dynamic get, and they all have their own different areas that you can change permissions for groups to be able to do this or that. 

### Example Preacher Permissions

The same permission implementation options and [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m05s) structures are available to all components build by component builder, as you trip the switches for the fields as well as for your certain views. First we look at components, [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m30s) sermon distributor, in the admin views you have access control. This is not the only place of implementation. If you go to the admin views, and let's say we open preacher, [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m28s) you have the permissional structure for edit. Now if select view, it is going to use the view name. If you select core, you will fall back on the core edit and delete features corresponding. So if you use the word view.edit you will see in the permissional structure an edit [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m51s) switch with this views name preacher.edit. Where as you use the word core.edit you would only see edit or delete or create whatever one of these you will select. This in relation to its record means that it will be added to the record itself. You can tweak the edit structure. This is only the global setting or this is for both. That is party how you control some of the permissional switches we just looked at. The other area is in fields itself. [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m25s) 

### Field Permission Switch

You have here a permissional structure, where you can say this specific field, let say the preacher name, I want to control that permission 'who can edit it?'. Is what you would add a 'who edit?' button. Currently we are not yet implementing 'who can view?'. Since we were having problems with a tremendous overload of switches being added to the permissional structure. Since Joomla now has made this change we might possibly add that in. [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m58s) Then you can even have a view, 'who can view that field?'. Where as this is currently just who can edit it. This is how you get the fields permissional switch. 

* ### Example See Video

Let me give you this as an example. Let's make that one for now. Name, [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m23s) say that it must be permission, save and close. Here I have sermon distributor open. I will open it's options. Go to the permissional tab. Then scroll down. I see first here is the help documents. And here's preacher. Preacher has site access and access to preacher itself, and batch, create, [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m49s) dashboard add, dashboard list, delete, edit, edit created by, edit created date, edit own, edit state, edit version, export, import, submenu, and then it starts with series. So as you can see it doesn't show name here yet. What we'll do is now will go back to component builder, go to compiler, and we will select sermon distributor, and compile it. Once it's completed I'll just click on the install button to do a quick install. [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m27s) Now that is completed let's go back to the configuration and just refresh the page. I'll just click on the refresh here at the top. Now if we scroll down again it we'll get here(preacher edit name) we set, you will see it got a new field called preacher edit name. Now I can decide, can this group edit that name or is it denied or should it be inherited? So the permissional structure per field can be added in this way. I'm going to go back and revert that because I don't want that area to be monitored. Go back [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m07s) open preacher. Back to the fields. Say no. Save and close. Compiler. Select sermon distributor, compiling it. Then installing it. Going back refresh. And we will see that the field is gone. So it's no longer being controlled by the permission [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m41s) infrastructure. That is how you can tell which group is able to access which fields. Even in which views are accessible through the permissional structures. This is an amazing advantage of component builder in its ability to integrate the permissions, not only per view, but also [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m07s) per field in a view. Your normal control also related to a specific view. Not only that, it also adds these permissions to every item. So you could override an item, and say ok this item I don't want that group to actually access this field. This is one of the advantages that component builder has above other similar applications out there. Its ability to implement some of the most advanced concepts that are currently accessed or available at Joomla. [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m50s) That's a quick look at the global configuration options for component builder.
