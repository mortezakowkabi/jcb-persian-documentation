Hi We still working with Summon distributor So I'm gonna use this preacher Which is a Get diary have set up here Are use that Ministration So you can see that I have This Back end View selected So It Intellect nothing This is usually how it will look When you start So YouTube Select This Depending on which Area of the Back into wanna get the data from Youth select Backend View Which is the Best way to do it I would say Then there is the Joomla Database Auction Which basically gives you the access to draw data from any other component installed that no Website So you select your Miller Database You can select any Database That Is actually at that stage On your Database Installed And that means you can reach out to other components Through this dynamic I'm gonna not do that In fact that's also an area which I haven't tested so well I You possibly might try to implement that And ran into some bugs At this stage I can't make any apologies for that since Really thing you should do is instead using Back end View Now My favourite why is the other option there Well it's because that's a future we certainly want in the application right And so I'm busy working in that direction And busy Programming so did that feature will work without any But for the most part if you don't do very complex Mapping If you just do a simple Direct database fetch like that Are you be able to use this it won't give you an issue What it really is about these other Linked Joint database structures That really would make it complex So And that my Cause problems I'm not 100% sure Obviously it did work But I haven't tested it well enough as well as I have tested the other part and that is this back in There is also the custom option Where you can just dump the whole Option of Using component builder to sort of write your Your your BHP for you And here you can add custom PHP It with The method stayed up for you So this is a custom get option where you write the code Basically by hand Where is this option Write the code for you So You select the back in view that you want to use Get that back and view Will be the the view that you could next to your component right So you need to type that you name in here and then select That package And it will load All the field names As a dot i d in a data asset ID a dog named Ali is an icon and So these are all the fields inside of this view An overloaded it will put this as Asset ID Now again I would suggest you don't change that What you can do is you can take Out Arrow You feel ok I don't need that Road Then you can Remove a row Like that And you can say I don't need the Arrow I don't need these Waited there Basically that's all the data you might want And then you will know That this would be the variable name Of the data on When do When these get is used So that's the The basic part of setting up again I need to mention that you have get types as well now the gate types have 4 of them There is the get item Which will get one item so that means from this feature table You will get one item Then you got the gate list query Where to get Multiple Items Ok so depending on how many items you want to get from the database you would select either get item or get list Did you got cast get custom And then you got Get customs that Floral And The difference between these two Is the get item Is what you will use only once per Purview So if you are building a custom at The View You will select a main get Either of a get item or either of a get list But you can add multiple custom get item Or trust and get items So You can see these as Other Methods that you're adding to the page but it's not the main method CF main methods which are these a get item and get list where we Which by the way is the exact naming of the methods that will be used And then you get got this custom get custom and get customs Which is really Is the same as these two it's just that they are not Main There will only be another method in the A model Which will bring data to the view So you can add as many custom Get custom and get customs Methods To your view as you like but you could only add one get item and you pay only That one guid list query Usually the way we were The sign on this That we would Say what is the main objective of The View What is the main dataset that we want to use in the view And that is what we will use the gate list query and get item for Respective Save the main purpose of The View It's a show preachers and a list of preachers I would use the guid list query as domain Selection here Now you see that you have when you do a list query you have the option of adding fake Nation So Basically that would mean whether the data should only return a certain number Mel July has a global number there Which you set in the system administrative area Hundred w Global settings I'm sure you that So you go to system Then Global configuration And then you see there is a default list them it Just one here And That is what will be used as the amount That limits the data being returned to the page Total owner return at this stage 20 item If I said that Big Nation to yes And if I said it to know it will load all the data So yes would just load some of it And no will load all of the data so depends on what you wanna do if you wanna do an Ajax Well you wanna be sure that all the data is being loaded every time and you rather use JavaScript Set up Nation for yourself for your for your view Then that is why you would use No switch most of the time you're just say yes And July world Sorry component builder will automatically add the pic Nation code to the page Also numatic the ad Tech Nation Go to the model And at the bottom of the page it will show a Want to see big Nation out possibly depending on The temperature using And the styles that on the page Bootstrap is not on the page that I want to 3 my possibly not look right and you need to meet you will need to add styling to it Component Build It doesn't No what style is on your page so they cannot make provision for all of that But it actually can load the but Nation itself And it doesn't Do that Ok Now hear you have data and You can join this data to other database tables And how you getting here like with the main source You're able to select Joint Views From a table A view Table which is basically the views of the component Or just any database table And to one of the database tables are often Connect to this category Z because Jim component the holder Integrates It's application If you add a category field To any View It dynamically set up a category for your component And integrates the category concept into your component so it writes all that code for you and basically the way July stone Applications like Article manager does it says using the same convention So you know I'll do my article manager is bringing categories into the articles Then that is the way your component is gonna do it as well And Here You can also lick categories You can say so The switch is off Deal with Mummy come and look More detail like this area And then you can model the date up there Model I mean decide what you want to return you don't want to return everything for But the one I want to look at first is actually this joint view Table will come back to the DB The joint view Table let you again select from any of the other views that is Part of your component And again you can select whether Richard return a single row Or a List of rose Now when you say single row it means it's gonna literally join it To this other data set that you have as your main data or your main source It will just be another Item in the array And so that's why you can't use the name Name For example here It needs to have that TUT series underscore in front of it So that it doesn't clash with the other day they said that possibly also has a value called name So then here if you say list if you selected You just select Anything you Series You see that it will get it will populate this area with all the fields that ask that is in that View Then this as Button here Basically You can't use the same Alphabetic number Why's in the hole In the whole query So No get function can only use a once and then be once and then see once D So You need to make sure that the That these are set up that you can Would make provision up to z z How many tables you can I have Only in this area So Basically you would First decide whether this row Type what type of return it will be If you said it to multiple you see that these names automatically update Because now The way that the get method will Work Is it will create a new Method Which will get this data An added into your item list Via this relationship so I'm adding the on field Is the Dot a series that's where the ID is for the series And the joint field I'm using the CID which is that one So that means in the main Database That is the a database There must be a field called series And it has the ID of the series I need corresponds to the ID in this list And if I wanted to return a multiple it means that The main database which is in that Kaizer sermon Can be linked to multiple serieses But in the system we are working with here That is not possible you can only Connect a sermon 21 series So that means it's only a single return Then it will immediately add this Series on the score in front of everything Do in Surat doesn't clash with your a table That's What It's basically doing Again you can remove the fields you don't want but Please do not edit The string It possibly would make it break I wanted to be possible that you can change this name to anything you like And we are gonna try and do that eventually but for now it's still doesn't really like you doing that And it it in fact you can be changing it all still I write it this way in the code that's That's part of why I'm saying you shouldn't change it now because it will break something but because it will be ignored and you might be Spect something else Then what it is actually doing So it still is gonna use this The implementation even if you change it But it will drop the fields you don't selected you say I don't want these That Then it won't get those Fields and you will only have this data returned And Begin here you can have equal Not equal Equal or not And Do we also have the in function That means This joint value Sorry If this on field Is an array Then you can use the end function To meet make sure that it Actually looks weather the ideas in this That's the in function And again Remember when we started out I told you that you need to be willing to get your hands dirty Now This code If we go to the compound and it's self I'll show you where it writes this code So Let me scroll down to the bottom here And let's see we're looking into sermon Picture ID Now we'll still get to why it says preacher ID When we look at the photos and the where Must go to the club No you can actually see I'm gonna refresh this page and then go to the code Ok so since this get is used in the front Of the component we will go to the front end and not to the admin area So we go to the front end Of 7 distributor And then we are Looking at the model right there get it Dynamic gate is used in the model to get the And we are looking at sermons You just make sure that Yes it's sermons Getting a list query and it's using big Nation Getting all this So Looking at sermons Sermons on the Under the preacher I researcher be this model Also you the way that I know all that But just that I could get you the code You can see Domain Method Which actually has this dot ID Domain Data set value method It is It is written here Siri can see it as it ID name ideas link types or description If you look at that You are it says the same thing Icon preacher series category ID So this is where it writes it And it shows you where in the papaya lyrics Number Then it sets up the Second 1 Series CC And Then You can also see it says series Equals CID So series There is series Equals The sea This table series ID And then it also tells you what it wants from see it once the name and the ugliest and then it wants a series Changes at the series Since this is in the select Query this is one There And So that a Rey And Transposase to disarray That is the way that you make use of Joomla Database PPI So it has a thing called quad name Which you can pass to erase And the first array being the actual Name of the Value which in this case is name and alias And the second array What you wanted to be once the query is for So that links this into the the query One-by-one See all the rows even the category 1 is linked in here And then It doesn't check whether there's an ID And if it exists it takes whether it's a string It was a string it answer quote And if it isn't if it's a number It just answer directly That is where Where is done And URI basic return false if there is no ID And so will look at this area in a moment this is done To the filtering Underwear Ok So I just wanted to show how it adds this Preacher as well as series To the query Look at the back Open up here You see that series And preacher And statistics but sisters sticks You see we select Multiple statistics Because for one 17 There can be multiple downloads right So there's multiple statistics Oh sorry not multiple downloads multiple files And per file there will be a a a number So if we look at how we does that It is first does the query and hearing get item It actually Adds a new function Called Get ID sermon statistics and with a With a random Key To ensure that it doesn't conflict with any other method We had to add this random key And it puts it into this variable and that something that you need to Come and look at And Possibly when we look at the the site Layout area as well as the tablets I'll be talking about this transition here again And the fact that you need to know That is in this variable And I'm trying inside of your layout and your side Use these things I'm trying to give you the correct name But it is not Water type correctly Possibly you need to come check this if it doesn't just work Begin all explain that when we get there Listen to No We're adding the sticks into this variable through a method which is also on the page and we passing the ID Of of the sermon So if you look at the car there you are This exactly what you're saying here We saying Ok gets a district multiple Went to the left Can you can select any of these And then Use the main table table sort a ID Must be equal to is sermon And then this is the only values I want to return From the east sermon So the Easter - is this value here Gay Samsung 8 ID must equal is sermon And then if you look at the code It basically if we go to this function we should be just here Thanks that ID And Places that next to his sermon Wizard into its place Basically also here's the two arrays what it What it is in the bass and what it And Ajax weather in execute checks whether it's got any erase or any values And then returns that is an object List And that the gets placed inside of this Space and sign here Now you would see this area here Is actually custom scripting So if we go back to the dilemma get you see that there is a custom script area If you click on that You see that there is Different switches You can select Get list query Or before getting the items After getting the item If you select after getting the items And you place any code there Then data gets dumped right after The initial items with Received It will it will add that Code in there and then only week The item So that is why you can model the data Right there in the dynamic get You gonna write the code For the data After it's been get And you can check If I remove this Cody Ritzy IT tells you that there is an array of items Where all values are And then I'm just saying I want to be sure that those items are set and that they are there Before I start doing your 4 it's on then And so get here I'm using Some double You know the street bracket component helper functions The Strain is there So you can dump some nice PHP Even before getting the item you can add some filters or get list query Before the if you if this is model list If this is item You see that Then there's a different set of Switch is available And so it Adjusts to To the type of Query type Ok Coming back to this area Let's again look at the database table option Basically you see I selected category and it's a single row that Sue turned I called it be You wanted left and I said hey Cat ID must be equal to be ID Which is the ID of the category The only one The title And the Elias So that is Are we set that up I need a title in the Elias And it returns that for us Then It links it in there and that's part of what you saw here You looked at the query Basically the sex section Now let's look at the filters You see where I'm a filter And where ordering and setting of Globals Number setting of Globals Easy we have a value in this query That you possibly want to use in a custom query which isn't even Setup yet but you want you know I'm gonna need this value in the model Then you can through this Global Action Gear You can set a global Again here you should maybe taste it There is an option of using this and State When is the different type of Set types You can set the value to state or you can set the value to this And Yeah you need to know Wiki so So let's I wanna do the name Obviously and this case is not gonna work ideal Because you got more than one name So you see this Global function only functions well When your house is returning a single Item so when you only do get I did not get list query But you do get Item Then this make sense and then you can give it a name And Due to the global Scope of the method The models are there Which you can enter actually access through other Model Methods Which are custom Methods Ok so that is setting the global The filtering You have a a list of possible filtering So Depending on what you wanna do You might select ID or user or access level or group or category Tags date Some of these are not really well formulated yet like date doesn't work that well yet But can't recruiters user group access level user and I need as well You know this function value of variable works well as with Array Array value repeatable value another All those already work very well And you can already use them and Implement them Now the only way for you to really Know exactly how it works you need to know little PHP and then you need to Violet and go look in the code what it has done and where it's placed what And that Is Why I showed you that this is all set in the model Ok So currently We are saying we wanted to 8 to do a request Get input your by ID So this is the The gate area that I added The code it says State the key Here SI unit we said it is a function bearable So it doesn't a change or adapt this at all And then says it must be equal to preacher So what we are doing a system component that doesn't know where the this variable is gonna be a string or integer That's why we have this function which first checks whether it's a string And then checks whether it's a number And related and built-up the query respectively You might feel that is too much and Possibly right But that is the only way I am And 3 more developers involved My possibly improve this Then you see there get Early Access Now we have a bunch of values that fire every time in a custom Dynamic get And it is the these values An orphan x you you might need these dull use So instead of you Having to do custom scripting to get these values on the page We had his values dynamically every time So the user ID the group The authorised group the access level The app and then the input values Which by other URL post He's on the page And it tells you that it's been initiated This is true so that if you have custom Methods Like this one Preacher It takes Weathered it's been set And if it has been said it doesn't say that again it can just use it But if it hasn't been set it sets it and also get in Sesotho So DC meat Necessary variables Global variables Can then be used inside of the coaches like the global variable we spoke of earlier Ok so Out of that Global variable We are Actually accessing This levels I'm sorry it's just one here Which basically has the gate use offer get authorised you levels Of the specific user That is now Uno accessed Model or the view that this model belongs to And if he is in these access levels So you remember that public is another access level And so if the user is inside any is a public it will this will validate true in the query Ok so We said that up simply by adding access level In A access So you must check in the Main Source table For a 6 a access And whether this user is in that So that means you don't need to add a state to you because The code is done for you Ok That's That is some of the filters Venda wear Is so you can add any table p Equals to a certain value Value could be another table Rugby field We could even be a global variable like we said we could set up So you can also be an idea user ID now you use the ideas already On the table so it could be Just user ID And or it could be like we've done it this case just an integer which is 1 So we wanna make sure that all the Sermons returned Is published And if you haven't I'm probably so many shouldn't even Return it all Ok so That's what we doing with that I am Dad is setting up a get list query With passion Through this Ordering method we just saying use the a ordering Anna send now you can order all the items Just as many as you like Be sure that the table that you Audrey You could even use a name right So could be a name As an ordering Table key Then it comes to it a descending listening Then it would be added to the query Ok That is also added ordering To the data set From Your Dynamic get method I'm so here with the joint view tables you can do very nice Dependency Calls From other tables in the backend And bring the data together into one items array That's basically what Dynamic get is for That you saw We have A The normal what I call main source on the table On the 3 in the model And then we have this other one called get preacher So That is another Dynamic get function which way Looked at Scored this one Get preacher Open it We see it so it's It's a custom Get custom And we gave it a cluster name called get preacher It's relationships So it is basically having No Relationship there Neither here so it's It's not linking to other tables It's simply getting the preachers details Right there Simple as that But it has a filter which is basically using the same entity And I access levels as the filters It's also using a where I suppose yes published and it doesn't need ordering Because it's just one picture but I know the less added the ordering I could actually delete this And it doesn't have any globally settings issue that is baguette preacher and so from the This settings here I don't think there's custom scripting nope prob this settings here Opponent builder right right solders code You see that we have this function everywhere called you like it cold and And then we using a global method a static method get you Do I get calm it's a method write build if you know you like it if you don't know it go to get UI kit It's a It's a JavaScript Library CSS JavaScript library which really makes modelling of your views very nice And it has components that you can use So like her tooltip and modal All these kind of models but Gordian is another component And we don't load all of it's components every time so what we've done is we've Written in PHP a method that looks at Fields that are text area fields And normal text Fields no mostly ok it's not Not looking at every field is only looking at the exterior Fields and editor Fields so in in this Component we know that this description field is a Editor field and so we are sending it to this method then you can go look at this Method Method In your helper class so there Because they use the method so So it has the classes that already has been identified which is what this Initial this component area sorry Field name field value model field null value is actually holding it Holding any component names that already has been identified this gets Fast also here with the content then we check in the car and whether there is a class UI UK on the score and if it's not false we we start looping to check what What what are all the components that are in there and here is the list of the components that are available So on the fly we are determining whether these components should be loaded just by Looking at the content that was placed in the description field and then we added back to the Array so it updates this eventually you have an array of All those items and in the view we go to the view Which in this case is gonna be preacher We open the view dot HTML We get to a place which basically everything is gonna be happening so These are of the components that go in component builder compiled that Ocation it looks inside of the content of your site view as well as your custom admin View Anita dentify that these components must be loaded for you and you like it and so it plays Places it here dynamically but since you could've added some components inside of the script that Restore in the description area it now has this get you I could component which piece base Ridgebacks back into the model and in the model gets this Variables value through a method which is here at the bottom of the page there Get UI kit component basically through this method it is reaching in Into getting that array and once it has that array we basically check whether it is set Whether it is an array and it it is under a we we said it To The Raid at is already on this page then over here we loop through that array And we load in those components CSS and JavaScript as required You always can be sure that the UI kits needed components will be loaded on the A user adding some of that components to its description as style Because the way you like it works as you just like Bootstrap you just Add the class name To the specific div or tag html tag and then it you know Activates the needed scripting a rounded which is a nice library but it's Quite heavy and you don't want it on the page everytime I know you could have done this through JavaScript You know it is fact they have a way for you to do this through the JavaScript but to me I fell Let me do the work in the html so I'll believe the load on the on the server And that the browser already has much more Leverage Freedom so that's why we This feature this is maybe Beyond the scope of the kid the dynamic But since we ran into the right spot you can mention it here ok so it is all Also placed in the query that is developed by the name again that's by Park you wear Fits so once you've got your Dynamic get set up you now add these don't have Gets to either side views or to admin custom admin use so these Dynamic gets his what What gets did they die for you and this where you model the data that you want to work with and you can then Use them inside fuse in custom at The Mews now next up we will look at adding
