# DynamicGet

### Sermon - Preacher Get Example

We are still working with Sermon Distributor; we are going to use Preacher, a 'get' I've already set up as an illustration. Here we have 'Back-end view' selected. (See video.) [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m25s)  For example: Select nothing. This is how it will usually look when you start. Select this, (depending on which area of the back end you want to get the data from) and select back end view. That is the best way to do it. [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m39s)

### Dynamic Get Source Selection

The Joomla database option gives you the access to draw data from any other component installed that moment in the Joomla Website. [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m01s) If you select your Joomla database, you can select any database that is installed on your database at the stage. This means that you can reach out to other components through this dynamic get. [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m21s)

This is an area that I haven't tested well yet. You might try to implement it and run into some trouble. For now it is better to use the 'Back-end view' option. [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m42s) The other option is there is because we want the feature in the application even while we are still working to improve it. If not very complex mapping is done (for instance, if you do a simple direct database fetch like  'cb_associations') you will be able to use this and there won't be any complications. [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m09s)  These other linked or joint database structures makes it complicated. [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m32s)

There is also the 'Custom' option, using Component Builder to write your PHP for you. At 'custom Get' you can add custom PHP that will add the methods data for you. This is a 'custom get' option where you write the code  by hand; whereas this 'Custom - dropdown' option writes the code for you. (See video.) [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m55s) Select the Back-end view that you want to use; it will be the view that you connect to your component. Type your name in here, select the package, and it will load all the field names. [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m20s)

### Dynamic Get Preacher View

These are the fields inside the 'Preacher' view. Load it and place this as 'asset_id'. (See video.) It is suggested that you don't change that. [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m50s) You can remove a row if it is not needed, but what remains is the data you might want. This would be the variable name of the data when the get is used. [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m13s)

### Get Types - Get Item/List Get Custom

There are four getTypes: 'getitem' which will get one item from the 'preacher' table and 'getlistquery' which will get multiple items. [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m41s) (Depending on how many items you want to get from the database, select either 'getitem' or 'getlist'.) Then 'getcustom' and 'getcustoms', plural. The difference between these four is that you will only use the 'getitem' once per view. [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m04s)
If you are building a custom admin view, you will select a main 'get', either of a 'getitem' or either of a 'getlist'. You can add multiple 'getcustom' item or 'getcustoms' items. This can be seen as other methods that can be added to the page, but it's not the main method. [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m30s) You have main methods:'getitem' and 'getlistquery', the exact naming of the methods that will be used. Then you have this 'getcustom' and 'getcustoms', which is almost the same as those two, except that they aren't 'main'. There will be another method in the model bringing data to the view. [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m00s)  You can add as many 'getcustom' and 'getcustoms' methods to your view as you like, but you can only add one 'getitem' and one 'getlistquery'. To determine this is to ask what the main objective of the view is. What is the main dataset that needs to be used in the view? That is what the 'getlistquery' and 'getitem' respectively are going to be used for. [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m27s)

### Get List Pagination

If the main purpose of the view is to show a list of preachers, 'getlistquery' is used as the main selection. When a 'listquery' is done, there is an option of adding pagination; it decides whether the data should return a certain number. Joomla has a global number which can be set in the system administrative area under 'Global' settings. [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m00s) Go to 'System', then 'Global configuration' where there is a 'Default list limit'. This will be used as the amount limiting the data being returned to the page. It will only return twenty items. [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) If I set the pagination to 'no', it will load all the data. 'Yes' would only load some of it, and 'no' will load all of the data, depending on what you want to do. If it to do an Ajax, be sure all the data is being loaded every time; if you'd rather use JavaScript to set up pagination for your view, use the 'no' switch. Most of the time just say 'yes'. [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m00s) Component Builder will automatically add the pagination code to the page. It will also automatically add pagination code to the model at the bottom of the page; it will show a 1, 2, 3 pagination, depending on the template you are using and the styles that are on the page. If bootstrap is not on the page, the 1, 2, 3 might not look right and you might need to add styling to it. [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m31s) Component Builder doesn't know what style is on your page so it cannot make provision for this, but it can load the pagination itself.

### Join Data Views - Tables

In this area is data. (See video.) This data can be joined to other database tables. In this area, as with the main source, it is possible to select joint views from a table. (See video.) [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m57s) A view table is the views of the component or any database table. One of the database tables is categories. Component Builder integrates its application; if you add a category field to any view, it dynamically sets up a category for your component and integrates the category concept into your component. [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m22s) It writes all the code; Joomla's own applications, like Article Manager, does it. Your component is going to do it the same way Joomla article manager is bringing categories into the articles. Here at 'DB Table - cb_categories' you can select categories. (See video.) [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m54s) In the 'Selection' area the data can be modeled. 'Model' is meant to decide what needs to be returned, as not everything needs to be returned from categories.

### Joint View Tables

The Joint View Table makes it possible to select from any other views that are part of your component. [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m25s) You  can select it to return a single row or a list of rows. If single row is chosen it will join it to the other data set you have as your main data or main source. It will be another item in the array. For example, that is why 'Name' cannot be used in this instance. (See video.) [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m51s) It needs to have the series_ in front of it so that it doesn't clash with the other data set that might have a value called 'Name'. So, if anything is selected here, it will populate this area with all the fields in that view. (See video.) [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m21s) 

Concerning the 'AS' button:
The same alphabetic number may not be used twice in the whole query. The whole get function can only use 'a' once, 'b' once, 'c' once, etc. [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m40s)  Provision has been made up to zz. That is the quantity of tables there may be in this area 'AS'.

Decide what type of return this 'Return Row Type' have to be. If it is set to multiple, these names will automatically update. [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m02s) The get method will create a new method getting this data and adding it into your item list via this relationship. I'm adding the 'On Field' as the '.a' series; that is where the 'id' is for the series. [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m24s) In the joint field, 'c.id' is used. In the main database, that is the 'a' database. There must be a field called series. It has the id of the series. It corresponds to the id in this list. If it is necessary to return a multiple, the main database, in this case 'Sermon', can be linked to multiple series's.  [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m56s)

In this system a sermon can only be connected to one series; it is a single return. It will immediately add this 'series_' in front of everything to insure it doesn't clash with your 'a' table. [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m18s) 
The unwanted fields can be removed but the string should not be edited as it may malfunction. Further development still needs to be done in this area, making it possible to change the name to anything you like. At the moment you can change it but it will still write it this way in the code, dropping the fields you don't select. [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m54s) If you say that you don't want these, it won't get those fields and only this data will be returned. Again, you can have equal, not equal, equal or not. We also have 'IN' function. [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m22s) If this 'On field' is an array, you can use the 'IN' function to make sure that it checks whether the ID is in the array. [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m45s)

### Dynamic Get Preacher In Code

Where is the code is written? If we are looking into sermon 'preacher id' we'll get to why it says 'preacher id' and we'll look at the 'filters' and the 'where'. [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m06s) Refresh the page, then go to the code. Since 'get' is used in the front of the component, go to the front end of 'sermon distributor', not the admin area. The dynamic get is used in the model to get the data. [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m33s) It's getting a list query and using pagination getting all this. (See video.) [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m02s) In the code the main method which has this id(a.name) or the data set may be seen. (See video.) You can see 'id', 'asset', 'name', 'alias', 'link', 'types' and 'short description'. [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m26s)

If you look at the UI it says the same things. It writes it here, showing you where in the compiler it has been done. It sets up the second one; 'series' saying 'series  = c.id''. (See video.) [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m50s) It also tells you what it wants from 'c': the 'name', the 'alias', and a series name changing it to 'series' since this is in the select query. [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m12s) This array, 'array'(c.name)','c.alias' transposes to this array 'array'(series_name','series_alias'). That is how to use Joomla's database API. It has 'quotename', which you can pass to arrays, the first array being the name of the value, which in this case is 'name' and 'alias'. [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m35s) The second array is what is needed once the query is completed. It links this into the the query one-by-one. (See video.) All of those, even the category one, is linked in here. [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m59s) It checks for an id. If it exists, it checks whether it's a string. If it's a string, it adds a quote. If it isn't but a number, it adds it directly. That is where the query is done. Return false if there is no id. [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m23s) This is done through 'filtering' and 'where'. 

An example on how it adds the preacher as well as series to the query: In the back open 'Join View Tables - Add', to find series, preacher, and statistics. [00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m41s)  Multiple statistics are selected because there can be multiple files for one sermon. (There will be a number per file.)  [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m02s) It does the query and in 'getitem' adds a new function called 'getidSermonstatistics' with a random key, 'Fcff_E', to ensure it doesn't conflict with any other method on the page. The 'Fcff_E' random key places it into this variable. [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m27s)

When we look at the site layout area and the templates I'll talk about this transition again and the fact that you need to know that it is in this variable. I'm trying, inside of your layouts and your site views, etc, to give you the correct name, but it isn't watertight. [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m51s) You might need to check this if it doesn't work. We're adding statistics into this (idsermonstatistic) variable through a method also on the page and we are passing the ID of the sermon. [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m19s) Go to UI, 'statistics', 'multiple' and  join to the left. You can select any of these. (See video.) Use the main table 'a.id'; it must be equal to 'e.sermon'. These are the only values that needs to return from the 'e.sermon'. The 'e.sermon' is this value here, and 'a.id' must equal with e.sermon. (See video.) [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m48s) In the code this function 'idsermonstatisticFcff_E' takes the 'id' and places it next to 'e.sermon'. The two arrays are what it is in the database and what it should be now. It checks whether it has any arrays or any values, then returns it as an object list which gets placed in this space. (See video.) [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m17s)

### Dynamic Get Custom Script

Returning to the dynamic get, it can be seen that there is a custom script area. If you click on it, you will see different switches. [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m54s) You can select 'getlistquery' or 'before getting the items' and 'after getting the items'. If you select 'after getting the items' and you place any code there, then data gets dumped right after the initial items you have received. [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m14s) It will add that  code in there, and then return the items. That is why you can model the data right there in the dynamic get. You are going to write the code for the data after it has been 'get'. It can be checked if this code has been removed here, it will indicates if there is an array of items where all values are. [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m02s) Make sure that those items are set and that it is there. A 'string bracket component helper function' is used to check whether the string is there. Here can some nice PHP be dumped. Even before getting the item you can add some filters or get list query,if this is model list. If this is item, you'd see that there's a different set of switches is available. It adjusts to the type of query up here. [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m19s) 

### Dynamic Get Join DB Tables

Coming back to this 'Join View Tables' area. Let's again look at the database table option. If category is selected and it's a single row that is returned. It is called 'b'. It is joined to the left, and set 'a.catid' that it should be equal to 'b.id', which is the 'id' of the category. Only a title and the alias is needed. That is how it is set up. [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m44s) Only the title and the alias is nessesary and it is been returned. Then it links it in there(see video), and that's part of what is seen here when viewing the query option, it is the sixth section.

### Dynamic Get Filters - Where - Ordering - Globals

Taking a look at the filters. Here is a 'filter',a'where', an 'ordering' and a 'setting' of globals. [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m12s) The 'setting' of globals is if you have a value in this query that you possibly want to use in a custom query, which isn't even setup yet, but you want to know if this value is needed in the model. Then through this global option here, a global area can be set. Maybe it should be tested here(See video) . There is an option of using 'This' and 'State'. [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m38s) It is the different set types. You can set the value to 'State' or you can set the value to 'This'.

It is nessesary to know  the key. If for example 'name' is used: In this case it is not going to work because there is more than one name. Usually this global function only functions well when you are returning a single item.[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m01s)  When 'getitem' not 'getlistquery' is done, it makes sense and then you can give it a name. It will add it to the global scope of the model which you can access through other model methods which are custom methods. That is setting the global.  [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m24s) There is a list of possible filtering. Depending on what needs to be done, 'ID','user', 'access, 'level', 'group', 'category', 'tags' or 'date' may be selected.[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m45s) Some of these are not formulated yet. Like 'date' doesn't work that well yet. 'Categories' does, 'user', 'group', 'access level', 'user' and 'id' does well. The function 'variable' works well. As well as 'array', 'value', 'repeatable value'', and other work very well. You can use them and implement them. [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m15s) The only way to know exactly how it works is to know a little PHP, and then you need to compile it and go look in the code what it has done and where it's placed what. That is why all this is set in the model. Currently we are saying we wanted to do a 'JRequest::getint by id'. [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m39s)This is the get area that has been added. If you look in the code you will see 'State Key' and this, 'JRequest::getint by id'. It is a function variable, it does not change or adapt this at all. Then it indicates that it must be equal to 'preacher'. Since Component Builder doesn't know if this variable is going to be a string or integer, therefore this function first needs to check if it is a string, and then checks whether it's a number and builds up the query respectively.  It is the only way to implement it at this stage.  [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m08s)


### Dynamic Get Get Access( Default added)
 
Then there is the 'Access'. We have a bunch of values that fire every time in a custom dynamic get model.[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m39s) It is the these(see video) values that you often might need. Instead of you having to do custom scripting to get these values on the page, these values dynamically gets added every time. The 'userid', the 'group', the 'authorised group', the 'access level', the 'app', and then the 'input values', which is by either URL or post is on the page,  and indicates that it has been initiated, and set it to true. [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m08s) That is if you have custom methods, like this one 'getpreacher', it checks whether it has been set. If it has been set it does not set that again, it is ready to be used. But if it has not been set, it sets it, and also again sets it to true.  [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m32s) These global variables can be used inside of the code like the global variable we spoke of earlier. Out of that global variable we are accessing this 'levels', which has the get authorized view levels of the specific user that has now accessed this model or the view that this model belongs to.  [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m00s) If he is in these access levels. You remember that 'public' is another access level. If the user isn't signed in, he is 'public'. This will validate true in the query. We set that up simply by adding access level in 'a.access'. [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m28s) You must check in the main source table for 'a.access' whether the user is in that. That means you don't need to add a 'state key' because the code is done for you. That is some of the filters.

### Dynamic Get "Where"

[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m48s) You can add any table key equals to a certain value. That value could be another table like "b.field" or it could even be a global variable like we said we could set up. It can also be an 'id', a 'userid'. The 'userid' is already on the table. It could be like we have done in this case, only an integer which is '1'. It is important to make sure that all the  sermons returned is published. [00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m18s) If you have an unpublished sermon it will not be returned at all. 

### Dynamic Get Ordering

That is setting up a 'getlistquery' with pagination through this ordering method we just says, use the 'a.ordering' and send. [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m39s)  You can order all the items. Just add many as you like. Be sure that the table that you ordering, could even use a name. It could be a 'name' as an ordering table key. Then you could do a descending or ascending. It would be added to the query. [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m03s) That is also added ordering to the data set from your dynamic get method. Here with the joint view tables you can do very nice dependency calls from other tables in the back end, and bring the data together into one items array. [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m25s) That's what dynamic get is for. As it can be seen there is a main source on the model.

Then we have this other one called 'getpreacher'. [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m45s)That is another dynamic get function which we have  looked at. It's called  'getpreacher'. If it is opened, it is a 'getcustom'. We gave it a custom name called 'getpreacher'. This is its relationships, in this instance it does not have any relationships. It does not link to other tables (See video) [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m04s) It simply gets the preachers details right there.(see video) But it has a filter which is basically using the same integer and access levels as the filters. It is using a 'where' and it can be seen that it is published, and  that it does not need ordering, because it is one preacher. [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m41s) It doesn't have any global settings. That is 'getpreacher'. From this settings, Component Builder writes all this code. You'd see that we have this function everywhere called 'UIkitComp' and are we using a global static method, 'getuikitcomp'. It's a method that VDM has build. To get more acquinted with Uikit, go to 'getUIkit' or google it. It's a CSS JavaScript library, which really makes modeling of your views very easy. It has components that you can use, like tool tip andall these kind of models. [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m45s)  Guardian is another component. Not all of it's components is loaded every time. We wrote it in PHP, a method that looks at text fields and editor fields. In this component this description field, is a editor field, and so we are sending it to this 'getuikitComp' method. View this method in helper class 'sermondistributor'. It has the classes that already has been identified which is what this initial model field value is holding.[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h34m56s) It is holding any component names that already has been identified. This gets passed also here(classes) with the content. Then we check in the content whether there is a class='uk-' and if it's not 'false', we start looping to check what are all the components that are in there.  A list of the components that are available can be seen. On-the-fly it is determined whether these components should be loaded just by looking at the content that was placed in the description field and then it is added back to this array(see video). It updates this, eventually you have an array of all those items. [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m00s) In the view, go to the 'view' which in this case is going to be 'Preacher' and open 'view.html.php'. These are of the components that when Component Builder compiled the application, it looks inside of the content of your site view, as well as your custom admin view and it identify that these components must be loaded for Uikit. It is placed here dynamically but since you could have added some components inside of the script that is stored in the description area, it now has this 'getuikitcomponent' which reaches back into the model. and in the model gets this variables' value through a method which is at the bottom of this page.[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h37m04s)  There it is 'getuikitComp'. Through this method it is reaching in to get that array. Once it has that array we check if it is set, whether it is an array and if it is an array we set it to the array that is already on this page. Then over here(See video) you loop through that array and load in those components, CSS and JavaScript as required. 

You can be sure that the Uikit's needed components will be loaded on the page, simply by 'user' adding some of that components to its description as style and while Uikit works like Bootstrap, the class name can be added to the specific DIF or HTML tag and then activates the needed scripting around it. [00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m08s) That is a nice library but it is quite huge.  

There is a way to do this through JavaScript, but I do most of it in the HTML, to leave the load on the server. That's why this feature has been added, although this is maybe beyond the scope of the dynamic get. It is all also placed in the query that is developed by dynamic get, that's partly why it fits. Once you've got your dynamic get set up, these dynamic gets may be added to either site views or to custom admin views. These 'dynamic gets' is what gets the data for you. It's where you model the data that you want to work with. You can then [00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuCoxPW35s&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h39m12s) use them in site views and custom admin views.
