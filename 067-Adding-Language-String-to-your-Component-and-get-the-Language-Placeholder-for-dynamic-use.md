This is a quicker Sort of tip on how to add a language string To your component Without a language string Being immediately Added to the J text Object function Which translates it of course So let me demonstrate So normal language dream you use this J text And you'd Add your string in there And then JCP when it compiles It Actually Apps that stream to your language file And then when your component runs that string is translated Where we goes it has a Placeholder in its place And you can then have multiple places where the string is used So that's Already there and works well the new feature Is Mostly used when you are dealing with a clause And you working with him Array In the class And I You want to have class method or rather Fields That is an array of Strengths but you can't of course you sis In the array of a class Value so That is one place but there are many places Where you could see this in action So what you would wanna do is you want the place I would be generated You want the String to be added to the language file But you only want a placeholder as a string to be added to your Script Because you're gonna later added to a date text Later in the script only added to the jade text Option to translate this place holder Answer offer knew we would run into such a case well I have fun anyway so The way weave You know address this It was a new Basically a new name Just text Like that Food This party looks exactly the same as the J text So Tomo seems like this is a class but it's not really it's just Something that the JCP compiler will pick up And it'll convert this let me show you how it will look when it's When it's converted it And you'll see why it makes sense you see I've got this extra field Properties And it's got these Keys And I want to use the key to get the string So if we go a little lower in the script You see I'm here I'm looping through that Hooray And The value description I'm only here passing it to the J text To translated So that means I wanna do the this translating later And I actually all I want in this array above here is actually the placeholder string So let me show you that in the code how it actually comes out Send a code here you see the extra fuel properties and you see it's simply a Place is just a string It actually took away the bracket here Yeah if you look at the way it was So I'm going to paste in the The one from the code Just said you can C When it's done So you can see This is what we add it in in JCB And this is what I did In compilation It added the placeholder string Which we can then use Down here In our J text To translate it to get the Specific translated string So that's a way to get the placeholder and to get obviously the string into your language file That's just the tip I know that It's not very obvious So I hope you come in handy those if you want to add language strings Today seabe But you don't want to have it immediately be Part of the J text object Call you want to just have the actual placeholder available 4U store Namagale This is the way you can do that Thanks for watching enjoy
