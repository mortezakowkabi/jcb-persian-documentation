Hi now did we have to learn him and get him Place let's attitude Side view and look at the initial implementation who go to side view And then click on new but since we already have That you created we just gonna open it or preacher You see the deer on the right-hand of 3 Fields that you can Populate with your Dynamic get methods the first one is where you would add All the custom Dynamic gets and there you can add multiple custom done in me gets The second one is where you add your main Dynamic get as we explained in that Tutorial you can add 1 Main get method per View a site view since it's gonna be billed in the model Either as a get item or a get items it is all depending on them Main gate weather it's gonna be a list or just an An individual item Yet you can include Dynamic Gates Custom Dynamic get as many as you like You also have this data available in your view So these two first fields are used to load The Dynamic get to love you The third one Is used to display the possible way that you might want to implement The code of a specific Dynamic get option You see that This one only displays Possible main Gates this one only this place customer gets Where is this is this place both The custom and the main kind of Gates Now If you select a Hey ya My girl let's go to One of these Main Gets Sermon This one here You see that it shows us A list Print out of the possible ways that you might Use the result set Obviously each of these are properly you can copy by clicking in it and then clicking on I do right click And Copy or you could click on ctrl V Pokemon The Sorry ctrl C in command C How to copy respectively the accounting Sometimes you might only one of use part of it and not the echo statement included Then you can pick from the area where you want to copy and then before letting go Click on control C or command centre Mac 2 Ensure you only graph that section of the text Once you let it go it will select the whole block and then Obviously if you copy it you will copy everything As you can see We then use that This code in our default View To to display the data In a PHP Fashion You can also get the the customer get here let me show you that one picture Like you see it says that that Values gonna be in this preacher And if we look here at the top that is what we check for checking for here Make sure that you have a Preacher And then this block Basically deals with displaying the data related to that Information This one here Checks whether the main items are on the on the page and now the main items as you can see Is sermons preacher ID get list So if I go down to that 732 I get List You see that again it shows me that the values are in items And it's in array So I can look through it and target the the object values And that's what's being done here We first checking whether it's On the page the values Then If we see that it is here We use make use of templates Do Do display the various Layouts And I will explain in an equatorial how to use templates in layouts inside Of your site View But this is just quickly showing you how to connect A dynamic gait Structure Methods to your view And then how to make use of the data that are being passed through to the view So this data structures here on the right in grade Is basically the the data structure that you can expect From each one of these so if I was to take number sermons As the deer Method that I want to see Then it shows me that That's possibly the way that it will be packed into the data set So it'll be found in this number sermons is how Now that could change Depending on your customer Limitation In your components custom clothing areas you might move this data from that Position to something else But the reality is this at least gives you how it would have looked without you You know I'm leaving the The normal Pass So this is just Proposing the dataset structure Which ideally would be that you would take this value here And Maybe do do this in the code Do a bar down And then exit And then Basically do a build and go look at this view to see exactly the structure If if you are finding that this the structure that we've shown isn't working exactly as a Often this helps us To sort a map the array and see where What value is found same goes with any of the other You can just grab that area That you want to take him to Put it in the Vaal Dam Do a bolt go look at this page In the in the front of your site And you can see exactly the structure of this The subject here Whether it's an array and array with objects or what Is placed inside of this value set through the dynamic get method Now I just want to quickly Pick up the Way that these methods are actually becoming available in your view My going to the code And you looking at Some of the implementations that we've done Ok As you can see we've gone to the front of the site Salmon distributor Models And we've opened The preacher model Use the printer model And As you scroll down you see that there's a get list query This get list query gets sermon as the a Table And then Series a Stacey table preacher is the D Categories is the Sorry CDP Is the B table And then it looks for a value An ID And then Set it equal to preacher And in sure that it The prison has access level 2 the item That's published And then returns it So that is the Get List query in the model Have you go back to our The face you see that we have Cement pizza ID get list as the main And I've opened that Dynamic get here Honey where is it Uranus And you can see that Sermon that is a the main the main table Then if you open here you see that series a sitter see they only looking for those values Preacher said is d only those values Sadistic E But it's a list Multiple These that are single are part of the list we re where is the multiple of it will have its own object sorry it's Method Look at that booty And then We see in the DB table That we have category a single SB Only does values So going back to the code This is the get list query in the get item After we have received the items We look through them And then in this function here get Sermon statistics and then a A generated string Randomly generated string to ensure No conflicting with other methods on the page Puts the values in I ID sermons statistics e So that's where the values of place And then basically we have a custom Method here like be shown in the dynamic gate you can add custom methods And then returns the items to the page And in the page You have a A file That is called View Dot PHP Sorry dude HTML dot.dot PHP If you open this way File you see that there is a get items Method being used to place the items in items And so At the moment we are actually interview at this stage And that means you can access This set of values Inside of that Class field And so if we go back to our Component Builder You would see if we were to select That message There there is the items Corresponding to our code And so we know that the ID in the acid ID in all these are in there if you scroll down You see that there is it sermons is too sticky see it there So that means In the array there is a P value Which has another set of array values in it So you can target these data sets Buy Cars Responding Waiting Values So that is just looking at the main gate Now if we were to look at The other custom get That is been added We'll see that here's preacher Witches and price them get No custom method That is been added And It also has it said of Values and it's database structure and member we said that we wanted to be Link to the preachers ID So get checked for the ID And then Set it to ID And returns the result Same goes with the number of downloads It's also custom method That said To this view because of the custom get that was added And here is the number sermons And we go back to our view dot HTML dot php file We see that those values are respectively being added To preacher Number downloads and number sermons And you can actually use these values in the view by by targeting with this number Sermons Now the view itself is As you should know inside of Two template folder Under the fuse preacher And this Main View as we call it all the default view is where that code that we on the page that we looking at right Being placed All these others are the templates that are extending the site View And they possibly are extended through layouts that are all available in the layouts folder So We are we are now just looking at adding The custom get methods to the page in our next to tauriel Locate depth about adding templates to your Custom Camp Site View And making use of these data sets So That is how you link them your first create the customer get then you come here you link these So these are the linking Fields and these are just so that you can see the code snippets on making use of these fields Respectively And That is custom Gets added to side view Thank you for watching
