The videos on the Home page of this wiki are being transcribed and edited to retain each video's spoken words as closely as possible. Screen shots from the video are added if they are deemed necessary to illustrate the text by example, and include the YouTube timeline location to quickly move the video controller's slider to where that frame begins. Links are inserted where they are referred to in the video to quickly view the site and explore the topic further while pausing the video. 

If the video could not be completed in one sitting, a suggestion is to use the timeline location in YouTube and place it in a copy of the manual or section of it in your editor as a study guide, using the timeline location to mark any locations you may wish to pick up where you left off or mark timeline locations elsewhere to revisit a concept that requires it. Many other uses are possible to enhance your learning experience such as making notes in your copy of the manual.

The transcripts also facilitate requests for a written manual. To achieve this, a Word document with the same material as in this wiki using a more polished format will be made available soon and will be updated along with the wiki. For those not using Word, OpenOffice is also able to read the document and is freely available.
