If you have a good understanding of the Joomla! API you'll know it can build forms that can be used in a component; it's done using an XML file. Joomla! Component Builder builds the XML file and places it in a location a model, view and controller can access using the Joomla! API. JCB builds the fields which you define in a view containing the fields displayed by the component you are building using JCB. These and other terms will be defined as we proceed. Let's start start with field types, then see them in action using Joomla! article list views and edit views.

A field type is needed if you are building a field. Use of views, field types, and fields can be seen when you create a Joomla! article. When you do, the first thing you see is the view. Scroll down and you'll see a URL displaying View = article indicating this is an article view.

If you close this article view you'll see a list of articles created in the web site. You won't see any articles here if it's a blank website. The list of articles is also called a view. If you click on a row in the list you will see the edit or single view. Components you build using JCB will build these views for you, usually two, in the admin area to list and edit your different data sets. Let's take a look at the views and the fields they display.

### All Fields Live In Views
The Joonla! article title is a text field type; the alias is also a text field type. The editor block is a text editor field. There are others like list, radio, tag, text, date, user, text-area, label. You will see JCB has placed all these in the component for you. You can make use of each of these different types by applying one to a field. All fields live in views which is an important concept to understand. Now, you might not think that a list view has fields and you are partly right. It does do more than just display these fields. Let's create a test article here to show what we mean.

### Joomla! Articles List and Article Edit Views
After adding some content, save and close the article so we have a list item. That is also a field and if you click on search all those options are fields. So, your list has certain fields which are only available in the list view. This is also the place where we do most of our features for multiple items where opening one item does what's only required for one item. There is a table which is part of the list that Component Builder sets Up. The item list views and edit views are built for you, based on the fields and input value mapped to them in the view. We will look at these other concepts more deeply but I need to have you understand this concept clearly. We will try and show you that inside of this article you will be creating fields you can place in different tabs, which will have been rendered in a specific order by the Joomla! component after it's been compiled using Joomla! Component Builder. Let's use Joomla!'s Article Manager as an example.

We could just as well go into Component Builder Since it has the demo application. See a detailed explanation of the demo component and building a local developer environment to run it. After selecting the demo Compile, it displays a warning because we haven't set some options in the global settings. It doesn't mean that there's been an error in the compiling. It just means it couldn't move the file to the git repository. If we deselect some compile options and start again it doesn't give you the same warning. Click install and compiled component gets installed Into this Joomla site. It doesn't have any images because that we don't ship the images with the components.

### Joomla! Component Builder Demo Component
If you click on add a Look It will open the edit and it keeps you on the Look. It also opens a list view where the list of Looks will be displayed. We added an import feature which the standard Joomla! components don't have. We will explain that later. If it's new you can add also text to your radio button. If I add something to the text field it opens an alias field which is also a text field. There is a new Joomla! repeatable field and you can add information to it. This was a quick look at the features in the demo component included with the Joomla! Component Builder when it is installed. The [APPENDIX](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/wiki/Using-the-JCB-Demo-Component-While-Building-Your-Local-Development-System) has a very detailed, technical explanation of the demo component installation and inner workings plus code, along with step by step instructions on building a local development LAMP environment to run Joomla!, and JCB on. It also explains how to compile and install the demo component using JCB.

### How Fields Get Into the Component and Use the Joomla! infrastructure
If we go to Admin views and select Look Open look you'll find the fields we just looked at. The name is used to map the field into the view using the field add button here. Reason why you cannot add using this area is because this is to edit existing fields instead of adding them. So, if you were to open a admin view you can edit them from here especially if you Have many components and many fields. This is a way to look at the fields related to this components. If you were to add more fields you would open this box and this is where you'll be adding them. Let's get back to field types because that's really where it all starts. We've already added all the field types to JCB that I think you will need.

### Field Types are Mapped Into Libraries Inside of Joomla!
Joomla! has many field types and for each field type which you build you need to set certain values in an XML document. These values use a checkbox Set Up in Properties. So, you have to be certain when changing properties that you adjust the corresponding field. This applies only to the checkbox field. Most of the time you would never need to do that. An exception is adding more field types which we haven't covered, or if you want to extend the existing field types. For the most part you should not tinker with field types. I hope this explains where the field type comes from and the amazing scalability produced from its use.

### Add Your Own Field Type Using JCB
With most other Component Builders you need to wait for the developer to add a new field type. With Component Builder you can add your own field type which requires mapping it to the Joomla! library. Joomla! has their field type set to certain types now such as a repeatable field which is quite tricky and needs special attention even in the code of the JCB compiler. But the majority of field types are very straight forward and simple to implement. So, we have created  tutorials to help you with the learning process.

We have not implemented all the attributes that can be targeted though. You might need to add them if you want to use them. For example, I added this show on option recently to all field types which I did to show and hide fields based on other fields values. Joomla! does have the ability to take control of the features to show and hide fields. This is an added feature which you might use yourself and add to your component. If you are developing a feature we can add to a Component Builder version I would obviously suggest to do that I would still explain much more on this topic as we continue. Getting back to field types I continue.

### Using Checkboxes
Starting at the top, there is a name which is called type And a value for checkbox and it must be set to not adjustable because that is the way it is expected. If you don't understand any of this information that I'm showing you here then a place to go to is to open the form fields and you'll see a whole list of form fields. These are the same for the fields you just saw in our component. If I was to take the checkbox in the list of check boxes and open that you'd see that they give you a list of those fields. Next type name and JCB tells you what is mandatory and what is optional and basically we are just mapping that data into this.

If we want to add another attribute, click on the + and it creates a new field and we add the name at the value which is in correspondence and some information is really for yourself this information block here. We put information there when  when you use this field type you are reminded what this specific at Rip And I I basically took this information by copying it right here from To my last website and placed it in there And where I felt there might be more said I added some customs text to it And what these values will do is it'll create an XML string like that In your form Which Joomla then uses to build those forms So Basically we first setup a fuel Type by Telling you Which input Values would be able to use for the specific field type which is the status check boxes. Save this and later you can reuse this field type when you start creating fields. Close this check box and go to the text field. You'll see that there is a list of the fields that used text field as its type. You can open one of these fields and at the bottom you see very something very similar if I was to go back here and go to the text field on Joomla!'s website.

You see that it shows you examples of how that XML line should look in the field area where you created the field. You gave the field a name and it is just for the system. The name used here is the one that is important. That should be the descriptive name which is the label. This name is just what it is when you add it to your view. This is what we used to identify it. I am explaining how to add it to the view in more detail. This diet data type and things were also explain we only go into more depth around What a field is and how to build one I'm simply now looking at few pipes and showing you how the changes that you've made in field type Effects I feel that you would build with that type So here is that Detail that was in field type Member on change And it tells you What is mandatory in what is optional but that's basically because I placed it in the description right I mean let's be country close to go back to that field type And then take on property. I added optional and mandatory to the description. It could have been done from here and of not true then it's not necessary to add it there. But you know this and the settings here are used when we compile the component where as this here is used for you. You know what this field attribute is and maybe as we continue to develop this component I might change it. I wouldn't make any changes that affects anything that already exists this dramatically.

The way the compiler works it is doesn't really grab the string and just put it into the XML. In fact, if I show you how a string looks that the compiler is built, the assessment type, you see that it is completely reformatted. The label is turned into a translatable string. It's been done done with the description. It also tells you where in the compiler. We'll still look at that because this might show sometimes and you can use apply a JCB Tweak to your component so it doesn't show it. But it tells you which line in the compiler it was built on and also in what file which is very nice. I think those of you that are developers will appreciate this feature tremendously. It also tells you the field type and you can see it as we scroll through it. You can see that Component builder really goes way out of its way to reconstruct that field. It is not using this directly. In fact, it parses an area to determine of it is a text field. So, it is dependent on that part which is up dude name come now and that part there. The opening exclamation and the closing one and the value in between them is what is used. If you prefer or by accident drop off this or that it will still work perfectly

These are really the only things needed to understand for using field types. Eventually these may become input fields in one big text area that leaves us with a lot of room and freedom. They are really adjusted easily without major complications and in any case if you start a new field, which we'll look at later, it populates this with the demo data and the demo data is actually values that you added when you created the field type. You see in the demo it is this value from the example that is placed here. It's from these values that the region is in if you create a new text field. It grabs these values as the values which you can then adjust to your purpose. If you you know implementation for that specific field at that moment and if you leave it blank it will also build it without any value between those two estimation marks that is looking at field types. 

Most field types have been set up for you and you hardly ever would need to come here except for a deeper understanding of how field types work and how Joomla! and JCB implement them. You do not need to change things unless you wish to. You may be interested in my next tutorial on how to use field types in fields.
