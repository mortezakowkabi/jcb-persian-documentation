Hi I would like to demonstrate to you one of the latest features that's been added to JCB If it's a request was made about 11 days ago Auto generate my update SQL After a lengthy discussion Surgeon was made to add the The future and I am basically done doing so first let me give you some back Background so you can understand where we coming from When you create a component in Joomla Then usually you have a set of views and these views in the backend are linked to a set of tables I'm so on the installation of the component For example if we do so here would there to be It actually Both the tables for those views on installation So then if you go to the back and I'll the component And You create a new item And actually stores the value in the database So that it can be retrieved that's very basic The reality is If you as a developer make it rains To this component Which involves new tables Then Obviously you would need to add Extra script to your components package So did upon installation If it's fines that there is already an existing component it will actually update the database accordingly to the new New settings the new tables or any Fields added or so forth So we gonna demonstrate this In KC Be There used to be a way to do that which still works by the way how was Emmanuel way a way for you to manually at the ink news it's equal State That are needed to make the update it was done under this version updates tab so you would click on the Virgin out Updates tab and here you would add your specific sequel Query script and Pawn installation If the existing version is below This update it will grab this and install it into the database creating the new tables and so forth So What I'm gonna do now is you'll see that at the moment This admin view has only 1 2 3 4 5 6 Views I'm gonna add another View to this component You can see it doesn't have these buttons ticked I don't not know how to resolve this it seems like This is a tubular problem Because there are multiple Columns of interview Because if you close it and click it again And actually fix the sad anyway that's just by the way so now here I'm gonna add a new View Called help documents and just make some minor changes to the defaults Added to the 7th position And then click save and click save again So now we basically add a new view which means a new table to the database But we haven't written any of the SQL Because with the new changes this is gonna be done for you automatically on the moment to compile this Component So let's do that So how are you we are we gonna again compile this component is see it's very soon is it still 4.1 1.4.1 So We compiling it Now what is the system is doing is it's tracking the history and it's making a lot of calculation Sims to dynamically realise that there is been a new table increment The version number And If I now Install this component And I go and open that component I'll see that menu view is here if I open the view there is no errors Why create new Hmm it'll automatically start behaving the way that is expected And That is really Say Text And then hi So we are targeting The External sources So forgot You are the things here Russia currency The database already stores the values And the new table is actually therefore in the database and working as expected now How you realise that This means that our JCB component Has been updated to if I refresh this page You'll see that the version number has been incremented And if you open the version updates and scroll down you would see that one point So wait now 1.4 point 1 Got this new Opac rating of a help document Table And a new version got allocated here Obviously we do not know what is this link and so we add this demo link here with you need to manually update They still But that is by far tremendous improvement Ok this also works not only worth The adding of a new view but also if you were to add a field To an existing view so let me demonstrate that quickly So I'm gonna be adding a new field to the preacher View I'm simply gonna select any Fields and soul removed again Let's call it Image And I'm gonna add this to left One That must be there in 2 And save And save and close So now I've added a new field to preachers And again I'll be going to the compiler And I'll select the component and just compile And again since of detected there's been a few change and increment it the version number And if I install the component And we go to the component To the preachers View We'll I'll see That new field actually there Image And if I was to select an image And save You'll see that it Really Oops I see I actually missed it The reason was that This component didn't have any history so I had to go and make a few changes take care Counted your building a component from the ground up it will have his 3 So this is only gonna be happening when you have install a component Bio the import function in the components or maybe using the demo component So what I would advise it just open all the views and save them at least once so that there is history recorded for For that View That is one of the drawbacks there is really no way for me to my gate that is true Since the history Of each of these different items Being at the admin view and the fields actually needs to be created the moment that you saved the item And it's really can't be done before then Ok So taking that an account I'll recompile it again fixter That so truth incremented to 1.4.3 I will just install that Again Going back refreshing there the preacher will see that Image field is back How select an image Click save and now you'll see That it actually does store the data for this image Because if we refresh the The component will see that it is again Increment the diversion If I open the Update area You see that it actually Added this new Altering of the preacher table adding the image Field And it is also added the new Version to this list Ok so that is a quick demonstration of this new feature automated feature It is in its very beta Phase we obviously still gonna Be working at it to make sure that it's completely stable So please Take a go at it if you find any bugs open look for other open issues which may be Someone already reported And start commenting on that what you think should be done And if you don't find any then please open an issue and let us let us fix this issue I think this will be a tremendous improvement today CV Making it Again with the one of the best Tumelo component Developing tools Out there
