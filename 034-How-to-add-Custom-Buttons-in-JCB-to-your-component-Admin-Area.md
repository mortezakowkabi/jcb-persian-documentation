# HOW TO ADD CUSTOM BUTTONS IN JCB TO THE COMPONENT ADMIN AREA

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)

How to add a button to the Components Admin List area or in the Edit area of the view. Possibly this had been touched on in previous tutorials but this tutorial will specifically deals with it. Here is a blank install of JCB, and this demo component had been installed or mapped.  It had been installed into this website. 

### Joomla Demo Dashboard - Look
 
[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m38s)
 
If 'Looks' is opened; it seems that everything is as it should, so an item can be created . (See video) (In Description;  'Give it some details'). Click save and close, and we have an item. There is a whole bunch of buttons and if you go into the test, there is also a bunch of buttons. [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m19s) All of them are usually there, those are the default buttons. The aim is to create buttons in these areas without custom coding,  of course it could be done  with custom coding, but there is a way to do it in JCB. Go back to the Admin Views and open the Admin View called 'Look'. When the Custom Buttons area may be seen, click on that, and say 'yes' to 'Add Custom Button'. 

### PHP Controller Method - List View Controller Method

[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m05s)
 
You would see that it opens PHP (Controller Methods), and also PHP List View (Controller Methods). It is necessary to understand the MVC, the controller, the model, again the controller and the model. Each view has two controllers and two models. Because it has a List view and Edit view. [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m32s) The List view has its own controller and model. The Edit view has his own controller and model, so depending on where the button is placed. It will affect which model and which controller is needed. Assuming that you are familiar with Joomla API, not much will be explained about the PHP being placed in these blocks

### Custom Button

[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m07s)

At the Custom Button option, click on 'add'. At 'Icon'-(Joomla Standard Icomoom Fonts) any of the default Joomla icons may be selected and be used. Then the 'Name' of the button, call it 'test' for now. Then the 'name' of the Controller method may be called 'getTested'.[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m39s)  
To set the Target View Type: Decide whether this going to be an edit view, a single view target, a list view or both, where this button should show up. In this instance, 'list' is selected. If it is a List view, then it could be decided whether this is only a function.[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m02s) When it is a 'Selection', it means that it is necessary to select some items. Then click the button for it to submit those IDs of the selected items. If it is only 'function' it is not necessary to select anything. If the button is clicked, a function will be triggered, which does not require that any information should be given to it.[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m30s) Whatever the result, you need to be able to code that. The 'Default' will be used. The 'Default' is very much like 'Selection' but it behave differently.  The best way to do this is to select one of the options, compile the component and go look at the code. 

### PHP (Controller Method)

[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m05s)

To demonstrate where the code ends up. Save this as a selection in a List view and save. At this stage if no values are added to these blocks it will not work. [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m31s) In order to satisfy its requirement to have information, two forward slashes is added. A little method, called 'getTested', is added to redirect us to the dashboard. That is a Controller Method. It must be public. [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m58s) It may be verified whether it was submitted from the current website and then it can be redirected to the components dashboard.  A method is not necessary now, since it gets redirected. Save and close. Compile this component. Select the demo component, compile it, then re-install it to see the changes. [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m29s) Go to the Component, then to 'Looks' and a new button called 'test' may be seen. If it is clicked, it will redirect us to the dashboard. So its function is to redirect, and in this way anything can be redirected. That is the first way of implementing a button in the List view.  

### More Options

[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m05s)

Now let us go back to editing that functionality there, and show some more options('Look'). Go to Custom Buttons. Add another button.(See video) Target - call it 'single'. Name - call it 'Work'. The Controller method - 'getDone', and leave Type to 'Default' and then save. [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m50s)  In the Controller method there is a function called 'getDone'. In the(PHP controller method) a public function is placed. This time we will get the model and  do something in the model. You can also get the item values. When this button is clicked, the item opens and it automatically submit the form. It is possible to grab the item's values. The values may differ from those in the database.  [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m36s) The values could be changed, by clicking that button, and it will submit these changed values. Yet those values has not been saved to the database. If those values need to be in the database, you have to put it there. The model has a save method, and you should do the necessary sanitation, and trigger the save method, and it should store the data.  For this purpose the data need to be grabbed, a verification done, and then return either an 'error' or a 'success'. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<



### Checking Within Controller Before Trigger The Model

[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m33s)

First we going get the values. We have the data, we can check whether the values that we want to use is there and available. We want to make sure that this is already a saved item. [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m51s) Then we at least check whether the id is more than 0. We need to have a name, and then we can check for that. We can do some checking within the controller before we trigger the model, and run the function we intend. Then we triggered the model, we decide what we want to call a method in the model. I chose something random and then we can create that method in the model area. And then do whatever we want to do. 

### Logic In The Model Methods

So we [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m32s) start doing some logic in the model. We have set up of above controller method. Now we are busy within the model area. Do keep in mind that if the model is unsuccessful, you want to do something, if the data is set, but the model is not being successful, you want to do something, [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m55s) and if your data isn't set, we also want to do something. Those are the areas in which we can add some messages that we want to give back to the user, to tell them what's happening. In the model, we are going to perform our task, and when we have achieved our goal, we give back true, whether we have failed, we give back false, and then that would trigger our messages in the controller. This is just giving a basic overview of setting up some model controller connected with a button. 

### Adding Code

I'm going to add some of this code in here, you are welcome to pause the tutorial and then drop down whatever [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m37s) you'd like to reuse, but the reality is you should actually be able to do this without my help. Therefore if you don't know what I'm doing here, then please go Google a little more. Go find out some more tutorials elsewhere how to create model and controller relationships in Joomla using it's API. The other reality is you can open this model and controller of the specific view [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m11s) in your IDE and in there you can see how the code is added, and what is happening, and how is it done. You can educate yourself that way as well. I'm going to add the code in. I've just added some code that you can also reuse and this basically, if the work has been done, we will let the user know it's done. If work wasn't done we also let him know. If we couldn't even detect the required values, then we just throw a major error and [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m51s) quit out. That is really the controller. I didn't populate much of the model because you should design your own logic, but I do return true so to give this first message. 

### Demonstration of Adding  A List Button

Then we'll go to the IDE change it to false again to demonstrate the response. And play around with the code in the IDE [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m17s) to give you a feel of how to approach it from that direction. We going to save this, then go and compile it. Then install the new compiled version. Open the component. Go to Looks. We can see how our test button is still here, if we click it, it still takes us to the dashboard. [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m01s) Let's open the test. We have a new button here Worked. If you click it now, it'll give us the work was done, because our method returns true. Let me open the IDE. Looking at our controller in the back end. [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m32s) First we going to open the list one(looks.php) which is the plural version. We see getTested was added, and there is our little method. If we go to the edit singular one(look.php), [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m00s) and getdone. Here is our method, and all our functions. And JCB has added the script to the translation text. Everything here looks fine. If we go to the model, we open the look model, we'll see that [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m22s) it has a new method added. So just after getTable, here it is added our little method. So I will add this to false, and save. [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m47s) Go back to Joomla and then click our button again. And now it says work was not done, because the method returned false. So if we change that to true again, and save then it should work. 

### Demonstration Adding A Button Inside Of Edit View

Now let's test out another one. Let's also make this [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m16s) not execute, save this(see video), so we can get this error. Go back to Joomla click worked button. Now it even kicks us out of the item. It says a major error has occurred. The reason why it's kicked us completely out of the item, it didn't check it in which is  not ideal, but [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m39s) you could fix that by looking at some of the other controladding a button inside of the edit viewlers, and seeing what they do when they want to kick you out. Educate yourself by looking at some of how Joomla implements some of these features. [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlEROk so LQgpMRE&t=00h17m02s) We got what we expected. We are going to change this back, save. Go back to the view. Open that view again. Click our button. All is done and good. That is a quick demonstration of adding a list button, as well as adding a button inside of the edit view. [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m29s) 

### Demonstrate Button - Both List and Inside

Like I said you could add one button, both as a list and inside, if you were to go to that specific button. Let's demonstrate that quickly. We can open it and then instead of saying list in Target, we say both. We click save. [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m58s) We'll have to add this method getTested, also to the single view like that, then save. [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m22s) Close out of editing the admin view, compile. Install it. First we will go look at the code. To help you see where the button is being added, I showed you the controller, I showed you [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m56s) the model. But if you go to the view and you open look, and you open view.html.php, and you go to add toolbar. You'll see that it has added a custom button getDone and getTested to the view. [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m22s) It is getDone method that is going to be called by this specific button. It's going to look in the look controller. And get this(getTested) method. That's really how it works. 

### Adds A Permissional Switch

It also adds a permissional switch [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m47s) to the button. If this specific user doesn't have the right to do the worked button, then it won't show the button. If you carry those permission structures through to your controller, it'll stop it even from being executed, manually via URL. But that kind of security and implementation you'll need to know how to do that. [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m14s) Look at Joomla's way of implementing it. Because you need to in the controller check whether this user has the permission. You need to know how to check that permission as well. That's just showing you how the button gets added into the view, and where that code is, and you can go look at it. I'm going back to Joomla, and open our component. We go to looks, we still have our tested here. If we open the edit, we will see we have got tested here as well, and if we click it, [00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBxWpJWb40&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m53s) it will take us to the dashboard and perform the same function as it would have if we click there(The Test). That is showing you that you can add one button to both the list view as well the edit view of the back end admin area. I hope this will be useful.
