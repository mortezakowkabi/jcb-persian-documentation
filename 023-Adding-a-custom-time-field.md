# ADDING A CUSTOM TIME FIELD

### Fields

* How to set up a Time Field

In programing time must always be linked to a date, because time is stored as an integer, and therefore if you only want a field where only a time is set, for instance 5:15, then it is suggested that a normal text field should be used and create a Regex method.[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m21s)   This could be done via a custom form filter. [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m51s) 

* How to set up a Custom Form Filter

To illustrate: Use this 'sermondistribitor' component, and go to 'modules', and then 'rules' may be seen. In there a 'rule' can be created. That is used as the filter name. [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m23s) Create a file in Component Builder and place it in the Custom folder and put any name in.(See video) One of these files can be used to illustrate how to include it. [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m54s) 

### Joomla Form-rule Example

How to create to a rule. I think let me see if I can get you some documentation on that quickly. Go to component in Joomla and go to 'Libraries' and to 'Form' and to 'Rules'. [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m21s) Any of these rules may be opened, look at what had been done, and follow the same convention. 'JformRule' is extended. Give it a unique name. Make sure it isn't one of these in 'JformRule'.  [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m43s)  Component Builder had already  constructed the XML document that is used in the construction of 'Form'. If 'Component', 'Sermon distibutor','Models', and 'Form' is opened, and for instance series.xml is opened as it already includes the Rule path. [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m17s) That Rule path is this 'Rule'(See video). To apply a filter, simply add the word 'filter='. In Component Builder there is actually a way to add this but basically that would be the same name 'Tel', as the filter name.[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m48s) In here(see video) is a 'test' which basically tests whether this is acceptable. A Regex may be done to validate whether the input field on the server site is acceptable. [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m10s) So this is the server side verification of the input. 

### Component Builder New Text Field 

When 'new' in Component Builder Fields is clicked, 'New Fields' will be opened, and 'text' is selected. [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m44s) There will be seen 'filter="string"' as well as 'validate'. Now the 'rule' name gets placed in 'validate', so the custom rule name might be time for example, and would ensure that only time had been submitted on the server site. 

### Script JavaScript

[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m13s)The next step to ensure that the user only types in numbers and a colon instead of anything else and would be able to do some JavaScript in the view footer. [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m37s) JavaScript may be added that targets this field by either adding a unique class name or going to the 'form' where the 'field', for example:(See video) This 'name' is a field so it uses firebug, then select that 'name' field and in firebug the 'id' may be seen. So with JavaScript the input of that 'id' can be targeted. [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m02s) If that 'id' has input and that is not what is expected from 'time', then  the user can be informed or the box may be emptied with a note underneath. But that would be a JavaScript implementation on top of the text field. If time is needed and if it does not matter that there is a date involved, a field like that had already been build by VDM.[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m36s)  The calendar field can not be used in the repeatable fields.

### Time-Date(Custom Component)

So a field had been created that makes it possible to still do that. For example: If 'Events' is opened on the Registry Dashboard there is a function where dates may be set. [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m58s) But these dates if I click in the box, you see it has it time adjuster. In there a date can be selected and the time adjusted then done should be clicked.  [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) With that selection the field is updated . If that is the kind of field that you're looking for, The implementation is quite different when this kind of field is used(See video). For example: If 'Fields' is opened and 'text' is  selected in the 'Type' column and a hint is added. (You could pause the video and look at the field XML.) [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m08s) Since this field is used in a repeatable  field, the JavaScript is quite different because you have been working with a repeatable field where you could add as many fields as you liked but wanted the date field to be active on everyone of those and you could not really target a repeatable field simply by adding some JavaScript in the area unless that field's ID was known. [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m41s) Instead of doing it in here(See video)   Javascript is actually added which is needed to make this field work into the repeatable fields structure.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<





### JavaScript Repeatable Field Time-Date _Important_

It's event dates, one of those values there(1196) is the id of that date field that I did I just showed you. In scripts (you can pause the video and exactly look what I did there). [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m24s) I'm basically including some styles as well as some JavaScript. I have a loop which loops 50 times. Because I'm only allowing, if you are looking at the repeatable field, I'm only allowing 50 fields to be added. In the loop I'm targeting through the dynamic [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m52s) php. I'm targeting each of those fields. At the moment there's a row added. I'm checking whether that row exists, if it does I'm simply using the jQuery DateTimepicker, which is actually brought to the page by the script here. It has some options which is tweakable, and that's it. [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m19s) That's how I add that kind of date selecting picker method in a repeatable field. I will hold it a bit there you could pause the video, jottle that down if you want and scroll down. This is actually the end of the code that is the start. [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m43s) 

### Multiple Date Fields

Another thing I have multiple date fields. If you open that(Dates) again, you will see that here I have a start and an ending date. In cost adjustment I also have a target date. If you look at my script you'd see that I have a field type array. [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m14s) Which basically is used to target those different fields in their different pop-ups. If you only targeting one field, you wouldn't need this extra iterating method or variable which I'm using. Instead of having to retype it for every field, I just added a loop in the php, it's just less code. [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m44s) 

About further documentation I realized that that might be necessary. Honestly I just don't have time at the moment, because their component isn't earning me a great deal of income. Besides the fact that I myself I'm using it and developing components and I have developed quite a lot already. [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m14s) I realize that might be a community project. And something I would actually would encourage. Everywhere in component builder, in any of it's list views, we have an help menu. Which actually opens up a website [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m39s) which has a wiki option. It's actually a readmine website. Here is the URL, you could see it, if anyone wants to get involved in in the community, we help improve the documentation per list view as well as per function as you can see I've already done quite a bit in writing documentation for every list view, explaining these buttons. [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m11s) This help button here. You could add your own help by going to the help documentation. Here is the list of the already set up help. If you open one of these, you would see that here is the URL that we're using. As we develop this component further we would eventually add more help documentation right in the component, but it will map to this [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m46s) website, because that way or everybody can benefit from any improvements. So the website URL for those of you might want to go there. It's projects.vdm.io/ projects/Joomla-component-builder/wiki, and you could [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m10s) go there and from there navigate. If you want to get involved in editing the tutorial or the documentation, and you say to me, I would help you setup documentation, give me a greater discount on accessing the tutorials. We could strike a deal. Because to me I have a time constrained. [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epA9zv4yWu0&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m40s) At this point as a community project I hope you understand. Thanks so much.
