Hi Ok I would like to quickly demonstrate how to set up a time Beeld Now you know that In programing of his liat time must always be linked to a date Because time is stored as an integer And 4 If you only want A Field Way only 8 times said let's say 5:15 or something Then I would suggest to use a normal text field And you Create a regex Method This could be done via a I just close this This could be done via a Custom form Filter The way to setup a custom filter USA This component If you go to Marshalls and then dude see rules And in here you can create a rule And then you would use that as the filter name So you would Important Builder you create a file And you place it in your custom folder Any any name Put it in here So let me illustrate that let me Well I'm gonna illustrate that I'll just use one of these files to illustrate how to include it But you would basically create a Rule How to create to create a rule I think let me see if I can get you some documentation on that between I think the easiest would be to basically go to your Scroll up here O2 Your in component You're in Germany right So you go to libraries Jamala Then form Rules Can You can open any of these rules And you can look And what they've done And you would follow the same convention She basically extend J form rule You give it a new nickname Make sure it isn't one of these Take form rules And then We are ready component Builder Already when it when it constructs the The XML document That is used In your Construction of your form Computer modules Form If I open any of them that say this one The ready includes the rule path Andrew pass is This rule So if it if you if you using a a filter So how you would apply it is this you would simply add the word filter People's now in component builder is there is actually a way This But basically That would be the same name As That I suppose T e l Ruby the filter Ok And then in here you have your Test Basically test song Whether this is Acceptable And in here you could do regex and all kinds of nice Means to to validate whether the input field On the server side is actually acceptable So this is a server side Verification of the input And so you you you'd see in component builder if I'm just go there New And I would select text Just a normal text field You see that it has year Filter As well as validate No I think the rule gets placed here invalidate That's right Validate is where you place your room name so your custom rule name might be time Example And then that would ensure On the server side that only time was submitted Now The Next Step 2 Ensure that you The user only types in Letters Three numbers and a colon Instead of anything else I would be able to do some JavaScript here in the view footer You could add JavaScript here that targets This field Vampire adding a A class a unique class name here Or Going to the form where the field Free sample this is a field right Seduce firebug And you would select That field I'm in fire by Coetzee the ID So with JavaScript You can You can target the input of that ID And if that ID has input that is not what you would expect from time Then you could Hi there scream at the user shout or just Emptied the box with a dollar note under it But that would be a JavaScript implementation on top of your your text Field Now That is maybe a long explanation But that is how you do a a a field if only you want time If you want time and you don't mind that there is a date in volved I actually have Build a a a field like that already That I'm using You see because in In your AP table Fields you can't use the other calendar Field So I created a field That's sort of Allows me to store Do that let me let me show you There is a component I'm working on Stration component So if we go to events Open an event Then you would see that ok Yeah I can set dates But these dates If I click in the box You see it has it time Adjuster And I can select a date And adjust a time and click done And it updates the field With that selection If that is the kind of field That you're looking for then implementation is quite different I can I can do to show you that So I'll open it you can see it it the type is a text type So basically I've just added it added in Hunt It's just a normal text type you could pause the video And you can look at the the field XML Now since I'm using this field in a repeatable Field PHP editor JavaScript Is quite different right because you You have a working with a repeatable field that you can add as many Fields as you like But you want this date field to be active on everyone of those And you can't really Target A repeatable field Simply by adding some JavaScript in in in in in this area year Unless you know that feels ID and so instead of doing it in here I actually added to Javascript that is needed to make this field work Into the repeatable fields structure so let me close this and show you that Case I think it's just one event dates So one of those Values there is obviously the ID Of that date field I did I just showed you and so in scripts Again here I can maybe zoom in a little You can you can pause the video And looking sucked liat what I did there Basically in cluding Some Styles as well as some JavaScript And then I have a loop Which Loops 50 times Because I'm only allowing in developer tab repeatable field I'm only allowing 50 Fields to be added So I don't need to look at times And then In the loop I'm actually targeting through the dynamic PHP I'm targeting each of those fields At the moment there's a row at it I'm checking with it at Rhodes just if it does I'm still using the jQuery Date Time picker which is actually Brought to The Page by this The Script here And then it has some options which is 3 cable And that's it That's how I add That kind of date selecting Beaker method In a repeatable field Again I will hold it a bit there you could pause the video Shuttle that down if you want Scroll down again This is this is actually the end of the code Start Ok that's all that it takes To to add That guy yes another thing because I have multiple data Fields so if you open that again You see that Yeah I have a starting and ending date And here in cost adjustment I also have A Target date And so if you look at my my script You'd see that I have a field type array Which basically is used to Target Does different fields in there different my pop-ups ok So You would if you only targeting one field You wouldn't need this extra iterating Method Variable which I'm using here Instead of having to retype it for every field I just added her A loop In the PHP it's just code Ok that's I think that should do it About further documentation I I realised that that might be necessary And Honestly I just don't have time at the moment Because their component isn't earning me A great deal of income Besides the fact that I myself I'm using it and developing components and I have developed quite Got a lot of reading I I realised that that that might be a community project And something I would Actually encourage So Everywhere in component builder in in any of its list to use We have an help menu Already Which actually opens up A Website Which has a wiki Option Actually a redmine website Here is the URL you could see it And if if anyone wants to get involved in the community We help improve the documentation A listview as well as per function as you can see how Freddy down quite a bit and Documentation for every list View Explaining these buttons And Even So on so this help button here you could you could add your own Help by going to the help Annotation And here is the list of the ready set up help If you open one of these You would see that here is the URL that were using And Obviously As we develop this component further We would eventually add more help documentation ride in the component But it will in actual fact map to this This website Because that way or everybody can benefit from any improvements So the website URL For those of you Might wanna go there It's a project start VDM Again projects Joomla component Builder Wiki And yes you could Supposed to go there and from there navigate If you want to get involved in editing the The tutorial or the documentation And you say to me I would help you setup Documentation Give me a great a discount on accessing the tutorials We could strike a deal Because to me I I really I have a time Constrained Manto this point As a community project I hope you understand Thanks so much
