I would like to talk to you about changing the licence template [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m05s) For your component This would be expected that you've made at least 40% change To any of the demo components Yes so Let's say you've changed this component Quite considerably Then there is this place called Licensing template Now it actually tells you there what you should do [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m34s) Select a file That should be used for license all files Found in Administrator component Component Builder Compiler Now the files What I should add to the note is actually the txt files So that means you could put any txt file in there And then selected here as a license template [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m57s) Now let me show you how that works Ok first of all It must be done When the Joomla component Builder's ready installed on your website.  So here I have a website Joomla Mount So in Administrators Component or administrator components component builder There is a folder called compiler [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m21s) And in it there is 123 4 txt files 5 txt files And going back to the component There is 12345 files I see it's also using the HTML That one will obviously not come out right Ok So These ones with the .txt's the one that you would [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m46s) Select Any one of those To be the template that you are going to use Now if you use one of the existing templates and just change it then with the next update Your changes will be overwritten So you wanna do it in a way that sort of Preserved your changes And the way you do that is you actually go Back to that area And then you select [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s) Or let's say were you selected default one And maybe you don't like this So you want to take that out like that And maybe you don't want to really support Or show that you used JCB so Take that out I really don't mind in fact I'm so much so supportive open-source that [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m36s) I don't I don't mind you changing Anything here And anything else in fact anything there And anything there This I would want you to leave Basically Because you could set this in the you know these placeholders are being replaced By the settings of your component [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m58s) So that means you could still tweak this But do it in the component But leave a license somehow Copyright notice So that people know how to use your program But Having said all that You do realize that the lot of the code between all the components at JCB built are more or less the same It's just little names here and there and that's really the only thing you copy writing [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m26s) Just keep that in mind You're not copy writing the Every little line really your copy writing the changes because The The idea of how built is already been copyrighted either by Joomla itself or by sorry JCB yes that's right so just keep that in the back of your head Your copy writing the changes you've made And that would you done And maybe when someone uses your component they won't think about it that way and I don't I don't mind and I nothing [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) Anyone would because we are open source community But If you do change your program to a proprietary software You might have to Yeah you know you need to look at What would be the implication because I think There's a possibility that some areas Cannot be made proprietary be Because of the Open Source license already being on JCB [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m28s) And on Everything that it's done Ok so that's just I'm not sure I'm not a lawyer I don't know how all that works out But I want to give many people so much freedom and I'm not really gonna check people up Someone else may there is actually places that Might feel obligated to do so I wanna be busy with code Writing programs [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m58s) Ok So this is how you change the template More or less you could leave things in the one that think that's the most let's see You can check between them You see like this the way to know what is all the place holders that are available Is really to go to the Let's see helper Compiler I think it's that infusion is 1 So [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m29s) You should look at the infusion Now like There is a company name you see there's a creation date There's the built date there's author, author e-mail website copyright license version Actual version Component names for short description description Image type access so they are Really Most of these aesthetic A content placeholders could be used obviously some of them won't make sense like custom helper [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m01s) Script that Means it's got add the custom helper script in that lines It's not gonna come out right So these Place holders are really from where The content is being updated in the file Ok so you'll see That it is the same This is a new method we are using to put it in the hashes these these hashes here So Basically the creation date Is this one here [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m31s) And it's getting it from the infusion which is found in helpers compiler So you can check out these and use any of those as you like The point being It's best to leave this in And at least tell people who who who you do did it so someone Can be blamed anyway And There we go now If you just save now It'll still work the default template will be updated [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m03s) But the problem is the sooner we released a new update for JCB and you install that update Is actually gonna over right this So what we would suggest the saying save as And then give it your name I'm just gonna say q Default q Save Now we have a new file And we can actually go back to JCB [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m32s) And we can just refresh the component area And now we'll see that there it is The new Template Now if I save And compile this component It will actually Use the new template now let me first see do I have it installed yes I do let me show you that So in the code we go down to sermon distributor we just open any of its files And that's how it's current template looks like [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m03s) Ok so there is the current template All the way down to there Now let's compile and see It'll update every file across the Spectrum So we just gonna say sermon distributor and compile Ok and then this install it Now let's go check out our template And now if we scroll up we see up it's got the new [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m36s) The new Template is being used no longer the old one It's the same file I just it just refreshed it In the background Ok so That how it works Easy To change the license and that's really means you can make it a small or is big as you like Any shape and size Just keep in mind that you need to escape it and unescape it [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) Because otherwise it will mess up the code Ok well that is how you change the license template Now So Make a wise decisions and how you deal with this area I don't wanna say too much more and put You know restraints up because really I know that The initial Desire here Was really to give everybody as much freedom as they need [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m35s) Thank you for watching.
