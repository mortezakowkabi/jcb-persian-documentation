I would like to talk to you about changing the licence template For your component This would be expected that you've made at least 40% chain Do any of the demo components Yes so Let's say you've changed this component Quite considerably Then there is this place called Licensing template Now it actually tells you there what you should do Select a file That should be used for licence or files Found in Administrative component Component Builder Compiler La files What I should add to the note is actually the txt files So that means you could put any txt file in there And then selected here as a licence template Now let me show you how that works Ok first of all It must be done When the Joomla component Builders ready installed on your website to hear I have a website by MT So in Administrators Component Wrapistry talk Finance Bodybuilder There is a folder called compiler And in it there is 123 4 txt files 5 txt files And going back to the component There is 12345 files I see it's also using the HTML That one will obviously not come out right Ok So These ones with the txts the one that you would Select Any one of those To be the template that you are going to use Now if you use one of the existing templates and just change it then with the next update Your changes will be overwritten So you wanna do it in a way that sort of Preserved your changes And the way you do that is you actually go Back to that area And then you select Or let's say were you selected default one And maybe you don't like this So you want to take that out Micro And maybe you don't want to really support Or show that you used a CB so Take that out I really don't mind Wags I'm so much so supportive open-source that I don't I don't mind you changing Anything here And anything else in fact anything there And anything there This I would want you to leave Basically Because you could set this in the 3DS placeholders are being replaced By the settings of your component So that means you could still tweak worse But do it in the component But leave a licence somehow Copyright notice So that people know how to use your program But Having said all that You do realise that the lot of the code between all the components a JCB built are more or less the same It's just loom Ames here in there I am that's really the only thing you probably Riding Just keep that in mind You're not copy writing the Everyday line really your copywriting the changes because Though The idea of how built is already been copyrighted either by your myself or buy Faster JCB yes that's right so just keep that in the back of your head Your copywriting the changes you've made And that would you done And maybe when someone uses your component they won't think about it that way and I don't I don't mind and I nothing Anyone word because we are open source community But If you do change your program to a proprietary software You might have 2 Yeah you know you need to look at What would be the implication because I think There's a possibility that some areas Cannot be made proprietary be Because of the Open Source licence already being on JCB And on Everything that it's Stan Ok so that's just I'm not sure I'm not a lawyer I don't know how all that works out But I want to give Billy people so much freedom and I'm not really gonna take people up Someone else May there is actually places that Might feel obligated to do so I wanna be busy with code Writing programs Ok So this is how you change the template More or less you could leave things in the one that think that's the most let's see You can check between them You see like this the way to know what is all the place holders that are available Is really to go to the Let's see how her Compiler I think it's that in fusion is 1 So You should look at the in fusion Now like There is a company name is sea there's a creation date There's the boat day there's two all the all the e-mail website copyright licence version Actual version Component names for short description description Image type access so they are Really Most of these aesthetic A content placeholder could be used of his is some of them won't make sense like custom how The Script Means it's got at the custom out the script in that lines It's not gonna come out right So these Place holders are really from where The pont in is being updated in the file Ok so you'll see That it is the same This is a new method we are using to put it in the hashes these these hash is here So Basically the creation date Is this one here And it's getting it from the infusion which is found in helpers compiler So you can check out these and use any of those as you like The point being It's best to leave this in And at least now tell people who who who did you do did it so someone Can be blamed anyway And There we go now If you just save now It'll still work the default and it will be updated But the problem is the sooner we released a new update for JCB and you install that update Is actually gonna over right this So what we would suggest the saying save And then give it Yeah your name I'm just gonna say Q Default queue Save Now we have a new file And we can actually go back to JCP We can just refresh the component area And now we'll see that there it is The new Template Now if I save And compile this component It will actually Use the new template now let me first see that I have it installed yes I do let me show you that So in the code we go down to sermon distributor we just open any of its files And that's how it's current template looks like Ok so there is the current template All the way down to their Now let's compile and see Apple update every file cross Spectrum So we just gonna say 7 days to Beauty and compile Ok and then this installer Now let's go check out our template And now if we scroll up we see up it's got the new The new Tempered is being used no longer the old one It's the same file I just it just refreshed it In the background Ok so That's old works Easy To change the licence and that's really means you can make it a small or is bigger C like Any shape and size Just keep in mind that you need to escape it and an Escape it Because otherwise it will mess up the code Ok well that is how you change the licence template Now So Make a wise decisions and how you deal with this area I don't wanna say too much more and put You no restraints up because really I know that The initial Desire here Was really to give everybody as much freedom as they need Thank you
