Ok well recently I was asked whether I'm seriously saying that Hella World Tutorial should be an hour long and I had to laugh because of course That tutorial is doing way more than what a Hello World tutorial should do right so Here it goes we gonna do the real quick Hello World tutorial we go to extensions Install We searched for JCB We open it And we click install [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m37s) And again install On success we go to component Builder And we click on Import JCB packages We go to VDM packages we select The Hello World Component for free with click get package We'd see that it has a checksum validation 413 4 [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m06s) We click this a link here To check and make sure that it is the same key as on GitHub So we can check that that key Matches this one And it does So we know it's a package Still Authentic and Then we we can say yes Force update and click continue Great import was successful and we go back to Joomla components we see that our Hello World component has [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m35s) Been installed We go to compiler And we click Hello World And compile It successfully compiled so we click install And We look at the back end We create a greeting Say Hi James [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m02s) Save and close And so our first greeting is set We go to menu Main menu we change the main menu to be a selection type Hello World Greetings And That should be it we save and close And we click on Joomla Mount we see there is a page [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m37s) Is not directing properly So that might be a problem in the component we go back to hello world And we click on the global options And permissions And we search for site Because there are some site views that we need to allow it to show Public That one and That one [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m02s) so those two will show and yeah we save out of here we refresh to front And there we have it There is a greeting Hi James we can click on it And it says hi James we can go back one And then click on edit It says I'm not allowed to edit I'm not in the edit group We can go back to the backend click on options [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEKs1c7LfO8&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m29s) And we could actually give me edit permissions as public but I think you get the point Hello world in place functional and It was really very quickly to do And that is the quick or the real hello world how to set up a Hello world component in Joomla Component builder without Waiting a whole hour thanks for watching
