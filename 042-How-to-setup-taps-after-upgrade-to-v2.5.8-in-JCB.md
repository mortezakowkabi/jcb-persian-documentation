Hi I would like to quickly give you a tutorial on how to now do the tabs I realise there's been a little change and how tabs are made [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFp_CtE0LZI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m10s) So you go to admin view and you then open the admin View An in the admin View You actually have A place called settings And if you scroll down a little there you can create tabs so you could create any Any amount of tabs here Let's say anymore or many ok and if you click save then you Basically have 4 tabs And the change we've made Is if you go I'll go to the [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFp_CtE0LZI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m45s) The fields Obvious gonna ask that your first save those tabs because if you don't save them they're not in the database But now in the tabs menu you would have all those tabs as a drop down The other side is also true and that is if you have no tabs setup so Let me quickly remove those Just Take them all away and click save it now there's no tabs if I now go and Open the fields It actually doesn't have any tabs it only shows details [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFp_CtE0LZI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m29s) Because every Thing will now show only in the Details tab So to have more than details as a option for tabs you need to add in the settings area There is a place which says tab setup Options And you just click on this plus sign here And an add your settings right here Ok I hope that will help
