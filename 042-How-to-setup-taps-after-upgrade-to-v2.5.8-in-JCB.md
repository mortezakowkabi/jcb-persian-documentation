### In Settings - Add Tabs

Hi. I would like to quickly give you a tutorial on how to do the Tabs. I realize there's been a little change and how Tabs are made.

In the Admin View, you have a place called Settings. If you scroll down a little, you can create Tabs. You could create any amount of Tabs. Let's say 'Many' click save, then you have 4 Tabs. The change we've made is, if you go to the [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFp_CtE0LZI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m45s) the Fields, first save those Tabs because if you don't save them they're not in the database. 

### Tabs Menu - Dropdown

In the Tabs Menu you would have all those Tabs as a drop down. The other side is also true and that is if you have no Tabs setup, let me quickly remove those, just take them all away and click save. Now there's no Tabs. If I go and open the Fields, it  doesn't have any Tabs. It only shows Details.

To have more than Details as a option for Tabs, you need to add in the Settings area. There is a place which says Tab Setup Options. You just click on this plus sign, and add your Settings right here. I hope that will help.
