Hi I would like to quickly give you the toriel on how to now do the tabs I realise there's been a little change and how it abs are made So you go to admin view and you didn't open the admin View An indie admin View You actually have A place called settings And if you scroll down a little there you can create tabs so you could create any Any amount of tabs here SA anymore why many here again if you click save then you bass Basically have 4 tabs And did the change with maid Is if you go I'll go to the The fields Obvious gonna ask that your first aid those dad's because if you don't save them they're not in the database But now in the tabs menu you would have all those tabs as a drop down The other side is also true and that is if you have no tabs setup so Let me quickly remove those Just Take them all the way I click save it now there's no tabs if I now go and Hope Open the fields It actually doesn't have any tabs it only shows details Because every Ping will now show only in the Details tab So they have more than details as a option for tabs you need to decide in the settings area There is a place which says tab setup Options And you just click on this plus sign here And an add your door see your settings right here Ok I hope that will help
