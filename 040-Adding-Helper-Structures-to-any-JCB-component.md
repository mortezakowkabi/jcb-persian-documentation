Hi Recent question came up that was asking about help menu integration For JCB components You see the JCB itself Hazardous Help document area No I have not actually had time to Expand upon this help document area as much as I would like to and maybe in the future We would Stall expand on it but it is a feature That actually is very easily add it to any other JCB component If you have purchased The Sermon distributor package Let me show you what I mean There is a place One of one of the repositories on the BDM data I called JCB packages So you go to BBM - i o And then jayshree packages on GitHub And one the package is here is Simon distributor You can Download this package But Before you haven't purchased a key for it you can't really use it So the get a key you would basically click on this link here Which is VDM dot bz Ford slash JCB Dash packages This will take you to a Place on our website Where you can purchase The purchase the Sermon distributor package Barrister Link that you would need to get to You can also go to VDM dot IO Which is Our website Some just open that and then under services You can also find Jamila Bassary JCB packages You just click on that it will take you to the same place So there are a few packages already available Which basically is a fully mapped component Inside of JCB Did you purchase this you would get information and a code and everything which will help Help you install the simmen distributor package So I'm gonna quickly install the summer distributor package On this demo website that I am using I'm not gonna demonstrate how I did that because if you purchase the package you would have all the instructions And how to do this once you think stalled the cement is to be the package you can go to the admin View Use And you will find that the admin views now has this New admin view called Help document It's just As one admin view called help document Now you by Default With Jason B have this demo component So let's open the demo component and let's add the helper structure to it to demonstrate To you how it works Now At the moment it doesn't have any helper structure at all it is just a demo car Component with only a few Structures actually I think it only has that Seattle view it has one view called look And got no crust and views but it got a site view port looks and looking So what we'll do first is we gonna go to the admin views I'm gonna click here to add another row And we are gonna add the help documents The support icon Oh yes we can have this an ticked problem I'm sorry about this where we are Busy phasing out the repeatable fields so you'll end up working with Sub fields in the future will stop for But the fixtures in the meanwhile you just closed that and open it again and now you'll have all those Boxes in place so I'm just gonna add that You again We gonna use the support icon and we gonna leave Most of this to defaults except it doesn't have meta we don't Don't use access We can do the import but it doesn't have a front end editing We don't want you to have one and We would have it in the 2nd position And maybe not part of the main menu I think that's good enough now We'll play Save this And we'll save and close that's really all it takes So you've just install the Sermon distributor package into your JCB that Added the helper document menu so the admin view and I've just linked That will do the demo component then I'll go to the compiler And I'm basically just gonna compile that there more component And as you can see here it isn't here yet installed on my website this is quite important Not to have it in installed on the website Then I'm gonna compile it Then I'm just gonna install it Now if I go to demo We will see That it has this new help her documents area Now at the moment it doesn't have any help her documents What we can do to change that this weekend then go to the helper documents click new And when it's open we'll select which group you want to Target So I'm just gonna select all Then I'm gonna select the I wanna target a view in the admin area The demo will be basically the desk dashboard Dennis help documents This import I'm gonna take looks I wanna target looks area Then I can give it a title And I can say what type of help when you do I want I want a link to an Joomla article What to put in my own custom text Or I want a link to an external URL This is usually what we will use when we ship a component Since this will then give us the opportunity to link it to an external URL which We can updating edit without sending an update or an air Uno and upgrade To the component we can just change the help menu itself sorry there they help pages which LinkedIn to and this is how JCB is been setup JCB is linking to an external Help structure but you can decide whatever you wanna do with this component you could say text for Example And you could say This Is the help You need And whatever And save and close Now if we go to looks We'll see that done automatically there is a new button here called health and if we click on it It actually opens that help And so you can now even going back to If you now click on new then that help menu won't show anymore But you can close out here And you can then go back to the help documents Great another one Again select all you could target a specific group Or you can just talk at all groups Again admin area you can also target the site area and be able to actually Link it to any of the front end Areas then we can say now we are gonna not Target the list but the edit area which is singular And again we can say Give it a title And again this time let me link it to an URL And then Save and close And then let's go to that area And new And now it's either that area also has a help button if we click on it It opens that URL In a pop-up and as you see I just selected A video And so That is how you can actually Link Two other external sources to be forgiving the help To the specific page in the instructions that is necessary And you can then Having set up a few help menus for the component you can go back to component Builder And 2 the admin View Area And Let's say you have a help document linked to component Demo but it is Do you want to ship it with the information that you've Now created as help Inside of the component then what I would usually do is I would actually Open this component Sorry this is admin View And I'll give it a system name of demo And I'll go to the MySQL Say yes I wanted to link it on select Table And then I would go to the demo table Help document CC demo help document click on that And I'll just remove some of the Values that I know Is not necessary Ok I think that's fine Created modified can stay I wouldn't even take the version out but Doesn't even matter Where can I certainly take that one out And there we go there's seems to be fine And save and close Now I can save this Or save as copy And if I have another component I'll just copy this one And link it to that components that a base The only thing to remember when you've done this Is it you must first compile the component before you uninstall the local So you would first come here and compile that component Now let me quickly show you in the code what is happened Basically hive Opened this zipped package of a component gone to admin area then to see Equal And then if I go to the install MySQL Document I'm just double clicked on that And it's open this document I now see that they obviously has this Insert table But it also has Insert Data That we created see there is This is the help You need there's a URL why at it And it will basically insert this data Into the database When this component is installed So Having done those changes and linking the table to the component It actually goes to the database in the extract these values and places it Into the dump file of the Component It does not place it into the update file just that you know and that means that If users already have your component installed and they install this It will not have these helper structures you'll have to use Custom scripting in the component area in the PHP tab there Place for update and uninstalled and installed How to add custom PHP script where why you can insert this data into the Database Ok now I'm gonna show you what happens if the component is no longer installed And you try to compile it The first thing is I'm gonna quickly on installed that they're more component No I'm gonna go to the compiler And I'm gonna try and compile this component You give me this error And basically it's telling you that it couldn't find The stable It couldn't find at table and it's because you uninstalled it And the only way then to compile this component Would be to go back to the admin review And D-Link the component from the table So like I said make sure to compile the component Before you uninstall The component which you are linking to So we linked To the installed components table The other way to try and avoid this Is there actually instead of linking to the table Like we did here is 2 instead use a dump file So I would say you click on dump You open your sequel File that it created And you copy The the values from that file Got whatever And paste as values in here Like that You could leave the comment or even leave a comment out And this way if we save and close We will now Even if the component is uninstalled be able to compile And still have this demo Or Shipping values Of the component in place So let's try compiling it again This time it compiled without any errors And if we go open the ZIP package And then open this install MySQL Dot utf-8 dot sequel file We will see that it added that dump Values right back into the file and that's exactly what you would like it to do Anyway This was just to demonstrate actually How to add A help menu structure To any JCB component Basically you could do that without purchasing the Sermon distributor from Poland The only part that really is necessary Is for you to grade A helper document And of course This help her document That we are using from the Sermon distributor package has custom scripting in it And it's disgusting scripting that makes it a doctor Bill to any other component I can Quickly Show you which areas discuss and scripting must go But obviously I would rather wanted to buy the components package It's really only in a relation To the articles And to the site views Any admin View That we have custom Fields That are a little tricky As well as the user group You need to Have a little perspective on how to setup user groups So these are the two areas that are difficult the articles one as well Because JCB when it has When it detects that this is a help help a document and edit takes the specific field there Values that are set up correctly then it automatically Build some of the front-end necessary concepts as well as adding Understand I make behaviour in the backend I hope this helps 2 Do at least show you that it is very doable adding and help Structure to a component What I think makes this quite unique Is that The component then ships with this Pre built in health structure but the user that uses your component You might want to give extra help or little different kind of help to the front end users of his Website And he will be having access to this helper area and editing the it and changing it to You to the correct wording and expectations that he might have Or she Might have And so that is the way that you could add helper structures To your JCB components Thank you for watching
