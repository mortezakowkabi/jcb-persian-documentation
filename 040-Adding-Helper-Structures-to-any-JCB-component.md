Hi Recent question came up that was asking about help menu integration For JCB components [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m11s) You will see the JCB itself Has this Help document area Now I have not actually had the time to Expand upon this help document area as much as I would like to and maybe in the future We would Still expand on it but it is a feature That actually is very easily added to any other JCB component If you have purchased The Sermon distributor package [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m46s) Let me show you what I mean There is a place One of the repositories on the VDM data I called JCB packages So you go to VDM - io And then JCB -Packages on GitHub And one of the package is here is Sermon distributor You can Download this package But Before you haven't purchased a key for it you can't really use it [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m18s) So to get a key you would basically click on this link here Which is vdm.bz /jcb -packages This will take you to a Place on our website Where you can purchase The purchase the Sermon distributor package Here is the Link that you would need to get to [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m46s) You can also go to VDM dot IO Which is Our website Some just open that and then under services You can also find Joomla Sorry JCB packages You just click on that it will take you to the same place So there are a few packages already available Which basically is a fully mapped component [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s) Inside of JCB So if you purchase this you would get information and a code and everything which will help you install the Sermon Distributor package So I'm gonna quickly install the Sermon Distributor package On this demo website that I am using I'm not gonna demonstrate how I did that because if you purchase the package you would have all the instructions And how to do this once you have installed the Sermon Distributor package you can go to the admin views And you will find that the admin views now has this [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m53s) New admin view called Help document It's just As one admin view called help document Now you by Default With JCB have this demo component So let's open the demo component and let's add the helper structure to it to demonstrate To you how it works Now At the moment it doesn't have any helper structure at all it is just a demo Component with only a few [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m28s) Structures actually I think it only has that see admin view it has one view called look And got no custom views but it got a site view called looks and looking So what we'll do first is we gonna go to the admin views I'm gonna click here to add another row And we are gonna add the help documents The support icon Oh yes we can have this unticked problem I'm sorry about this while we are Busy phasing out the repeatable fields so you'll end up working with Sub fields in the future sub forms But to fix this in the meanwhile you just closed that and open it again and now you'll have all those Tick boxes in place so I'm just gonna add that [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m19s) view again We gonna use the support icon and we gonna leave Most of this to defaults except it doesn't have meta we don't Don't use access We can do the import but it doesn't have a front end editing We don't want it to have one and We would have it in the 2nd position And maybe not part of the main menu I think that's good enough now We'll play [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m52s) Save this And we'll save and close that's really all it takes So you've just install the Sermon distributor package into your JCB that Added the helper document menu sorry the admin view and I've just linked That view to the demo component then I'll go to the compiler And I'm basically just gonna compile that demo component And as you can see here it isn't here yet installed on my website this is quite important Not to have it in installed on the website Then I'm gonna compile it Then I'm just gonna install it [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m43s) Now if I go to demo We will see That it has this new helper documents area Now at the moment it doesn't have any helper documents What we can do to change that is we can then go to the helper documents click new And when it's opened we'll select which group you want to Target So I'm just gonna select all Then I'm gonna select the I wanna target a view in the admin area The demo will be basically the desk dashboard Then there is help documents [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m23s) This import I'm gonna take looks I'm on a target looks area Then I can give it a title And I can say what type of help do I want, I want a link to an Joomla article Want to put in my own custom text Or I want a link to an external URL This is usually what we will use when we ship a component Since this will then give us the opportunity to link it to an external URL which We can update an edit without sending an update or you know and upgrade To the component we can just change the help menu itself sorry the the help pages which We linked them to and this is how JCB is been setup JCB is linking to an external Help structure but you can decide whatever you wanna do with this component you could say text for [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m20s) Example And you could say This Is the help You need And whatever And save and close Now if we go to looks We'll see that then automatically there is a new button here called help and if we click on it It actually opens that help [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m47s) And so you can now even going back to If you now click on new then that help menu won't show anymore But you can close out here And you can then go back to the help documents create another one Again select or you could target a specific group Or you can just target all groups Again admin area you can also target the site area and be able to actually Link it to any of the front end Areas then we can say now we are wanna not [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m32s) Target the list but the edit area which is singular And again we can say Give it a title And again this time let me link it to an URL And then Save and close And then let's go to that area And new And now we'd see that area also has a help button if we click on it It opens that URL [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m13s) In a pop-up and as you see I just selected A video And so That is how you can actually Link To other external sources to be giving the help To the specific page in the instructions that is necessary And you can then Having set up a few help menus for the component you can go back to component Builder And to the admin View [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m46s) Area And Let's say you have a help document linked to component Demo but it is You want to ship it with the information that you've Now created as help Inside of the component then what I would usually do is I would actually Open this component Sorry this admin View And I'll give it a system name of demo And I'll go to the MySQL [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m31s) Say yes I wanted to link it I'll select Table And then I would go to the demo table Help document you see demo help document click on that And I'll just remove some of the Values that I know Is not necessary Ok I think that's fine Created modified can stay I wouldn't even take the version out but [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m05s) Doesn't even matter We can most certainly take that one out And there we go those seems to be fine And save and close Now I can save this Or save as copy And if I have another component I'll just copy this one And link it to that components data base The only thing to remember when you've done this [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m36s) Is it you must first compile the component before you uninstall the local component So you would first come here and compile that component Now let me quickly show you in the code what is happened Basically I've Opened this zipped package of a component gone to admin area then to sql And then if I go to the install MySQL Document I'm just double clicked on that And it's open this document I'll now see that they obviously has this [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m25s) Insert table But it also has Insert Data That we created see there is This is the help You need there's a URL I added And it will basically insert this data Into the database When this component is installed [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m50s) So Having done those changes and linking the table to the component It actually goes to the database in the extract these values and places it Into the dump file of the Component It does not place it into the update file just that you know and that means that If users already have your component installed and they install this It will not add these helper structures you'll have to use Custom scripting in the Joomla component area in the PHP tab there is a place for update and uninstalled and installed [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m40s) To add custom PHP script where why you can insert this data into the Database Ok now I'm gonna show you what happens if the component is no longer installed And you try to compile it The first thing is I'm gonna quickly uninstalled the demo component Now I'm gonna go to the compiler And I'm gonna try and compile this component It will give me this error And basically it's telling you that it couldn't find This table [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m24s) It couldn't find that table and it's because you uninstalled it And the only way then to compile this component Would be to go back to the admin view And deLink the component from the table So like I said make sure to compile the component Before you uninstall The component which you are linking to So we linked To the installed components table The other way to try and avoid this [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m55s) Is to actually instead of linking to the table Like we did here is to instead use a dump file So I would say you click on dump You open your sql File that it created And you copy The the values from that file or cut whatever And paste as values in here Like that [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m28s) You could leave the comment or even leave a comment out And this way if we save and close We will now Even if the component is uninstalled be able to compile And still have this demo Or Shipping values Of the component in place So let's try compiling it again This time it compiled without any errors [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m04s) And if we go open the ZIP package And then open this install MySQL .utf8.sql file We will see that it added that dump Values right back into the file and that's exactly what you would like it to do Anyway This was just to demonstrate actually How to add A help menu structure To any JCB component [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m45s) Basically you could do that without purchasing the Sermon distributor component The only part that really is necessary Is for you to create a helper document And of course This helper document That we are using from the Sermon distributor package has custom scripting in it And it's this custom scripting that makes it a adaptable to any other component I can Quickly Show you which areas this custom scripting must go [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m18s) But obviously I would rather wanted to buy the components package It's really only in a relation To the articles And to the site views And the admin View That we have custom Fields That are a little tricky As well as the user group You need to [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m42s) Have a little perspective on how to setup user groups So these are the two areas that are difficult the articles one as well Because JCB when it has When it detects that this is a help helper document and it detects those specific field Values that are set up correctly then it automatically Build some of the front-end necessary concepts as well as adding This dynamic behaviour in the backend I hope this helps to To at least show you that it is very doable the adding and help [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m25s) Structure to a component What I think makes this quite unique Is that The component then ships with this Pre built in help structure but the user that uses your component He might want to give extra help or little different kind of help to the front end users of his Website And he will be having access to this helper area and editing it and changing it to To the correct wording and expectations that he might have Or she [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9YPu9emws&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m59s) Might have And so that is the way that you could add helper structures To your JCB components Thank you for watching
