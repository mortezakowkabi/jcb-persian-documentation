The option to now add your own custom dashboard To your component has actually finally come I might have mentioned this in some previous tutorials but it's somewhat hidden So I thought Well let's do it quick tutorial just about this Turn the past or component basically it's layout ended up as the dashboard looking like this Obviously with your own icons But you could do only about what you see here And this is still the default dashboard So if you don't add your own You're basically Builders for you Based on your Fields based off on it's icons and layout selection So you could add tabs like we have here And these two halves are quite powerful You can really Ads A lot Functionality within that But for some of you this might be boring and not really what you would like and fact you wanna look different You don't want your component to look like it was built with chasing me And I don't blame you because that is what makes components Valuable Is that they are actually unique An app that is really why JCP exists it exist because I didn't want a cookie cutter I wanted to build my own components that actually look different from Each other in yet have similar Behaviour because of my company's approach But None of the others out there actually Could do that for me They all We ended up looking Just like The one We were using Janelle JCB We constantly Trying to make sure that this is not the case in fact that's why the side view area is it a bit more difficult Because you wanna give you The opportunity to express your components functionality In a way that you need to you This might be a challenge but in the long run believe me it is the advantage If you could do it without knowing Any job script with CSS or HTML Then anyone else can do it as well So there is like a little bit of her Yeah incentive to sort of Get your head around some of these Technologies And any case to be a good component developer and not knowing PHP And those Front-end languages Is most certainly a risk ok Well So without further ado if we were to go We'll have your this common known Hello world Component Panoply Open it in the website now This is it dashboard Now it doesn't have a custom dashboard And I'm not gonna add one at this point but I am gonna Take-away The dashboard it has and So then it's sort of behaves Like the article manager for example If we would go here there's an in the components area there is a new tab or rather TabGold lips Sorry - uninstall You see here it has the default And then here It has some description of what that means If you click on dynamic It actually gives you a list of all the available Sites Views that are linked to the component And that would be custom Hatton views As well as Normal admin views it will show you a list of them all And you can dance select Any of those And that will become the new dashboard for your component So basically save and close And go to the compiler and compile the Hello world Component And basically just reinstall So to demonstrate how that changed our components behaviour So Store Then we will Basically go to components and click on This hello world link To see what it does now as its default dashboard And so it loads the listview and the dashboard is gone So from this point forward Your whole world component Actually Looks like this And it doesn't have a dashboard Now you could use a custom dashboard Which and In our case If you If you're using A component That has custom admin views So JCB has The compiler and the gets Snippets area as custom admin views So if we were to do the similar Sing with JCB We could just as well Select One of those Obviously say dynamic And select One of those views So scroll down a bit Where is it There The compiler we could make the compiler Jcps Dashboard Now I know it's gonna break a lot of things so my life suppose but let's try it out So we got a CB now we switched it to have another dashboard Instead of the normal dashboard The compiler to hear And then install Before install it I just want to tell you what I meant by Things My Break We got a bunch of times here And all these times are getting information and making it available To you so you could just say get Griffin And we got the version here in the last build date and Yeah so you are basically gonna remove this whole area So or we just did If I click on this end Paul Receive First It tells us that this language string is no longer here And at first it seems like it's a broken issue but if we refreshed it You see rail actually remove it And so it's just a cash thing there So basically the dashboard scar And if I was to Go here and click on Component builder Hill from now on open right at the compiler And that will now be used before page Which is what we told it And so the behaviour is correct We don't see any issues And actually if you were to gonna go to the code Dashboard is completely removed all is files everything And so numb trace of it is left Obviously to undo this Liquids Simply say default again And save and close And then compile it again And it will taste the dashboard back So That's not really any harm done to the component But for those of you wanna take the custom admin views And design a much more Impressive maybe not at boring Dashboard Can L do so By Simply using this new feature And I'm sure it's gonna be a lot of fun So there we refresh now Are dashboards back and if you click on it There we go everything is fine again Shoo away thanks for watching
