# COMPONENT SETTINGS

Now that we've added the admin views to the component, let's look at some of the features still available inside  components. Adding your custom admin views is done there and the site views is done here. (See video.) There is a 'custom admin menus'. Controlling the menu structures for these and custom admin views in the site views are done inside these. This is if you are adding custom back end views that haven't been developed inside of component builder. [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m40s)

**Compiler Info**

Component builder its self has a compiler view. It's this view here. This entire view is done outside component builder. [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m04s) It needs a model, a controller, a view, and everything in regards to it if you look at the infrastructure of component builder. [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m32s) You would see there is place called custom. Inside custom everything that you want to include inside of your component is added into the custom folder. Anything that you want to integrate is in here.  [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m02s) You might find a bunch of things already there. I would encourage you not to remove them because depending on what you do in component builder it will automatically include these. (See video.) [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m32s) All of these are in the custom tab. There are files as well. The component builder itself has its compiler view here. It is just empty folders. The actual files and the default compiler file is here; if I open it the script shows a dropdown of items. [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m59s) I also have the controller, the model, the compiler, and the helper file. I am including it into my component.[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m48s)

**Adding Custom Files - Folders**

In files I'm including a bunch of things and that also means I'm including the 'Compiler' and then I take this file and put it in 'admin views compiler' and rename it. In this instance it got the wrong name. If you add the right name at the end of the string and click 'yes', it will rename that file to this(See video), that is adding custom [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m16s) files as well as custom folders. I'm grabbing the compiler views and dumping it into views, and rename it to compiler, compiler views becomes compiler inside of the views folder. The system will first build the folders and then move your data your files to those folders. You will put the files here(see video). [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m44s) And then have the system do the folders and then it will move the files. That's adding custom files to any component. 

**Adding Custom Admin Views**

This custom admin menu is basically what I use to the map the compiler menu. I want to call it compiler, the code is compiler. I'm not using a link, because it's not another extension or another website or something like that which you can also do. Then I would select an icon. Here is the information. It's the same kind of switches [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m17s) as with adding a back end admin view. You can tweak whether it should be an admin menu or be a dashboard or be a submenu. Then also in which order behind it says 'select before what admin view this one should be placed'. We are placing it before component.


 That means it can [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m49s) go at the very top. That is adding a custom admin menu. Because of custom files and folders that you have created by hand and are importing into your component when you compile it. The same is done with the compiler of component builder. I'm actually including it as files. [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m16s) There is the compiler(See video). I took all the compiler files and I put it into the folder called compiler. There it is and it's a folder which moves all the files at once. That can also be done, like for example, as you see here 'PHPExcel' which is a folder with a lot of content in it. [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m48s) I put everything I wanted to move inside of this folder and then in my component I simply target that folder and it pulls it in .That's simply shows how a whole lot of folders are added to component builder. When I need a back end admin view custom [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m18s) added, this feature here(Custom Admin Views - add) does that. 

**Adding Custom Config Fields**

A quick overview of the area called config. This area deals with something that is actually quite useful. That is to set up your back end global fields. [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m42s) Let me go to sermon distributor. There we've done some really amazing things.Go to 'Sermon distributor', 'settings' and then 'config'. As you can see it is a very long list of things. If we go to the actual component, let me open it and then I'll click on options. [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m25s) You will see that it has many tabs. <<<<<<




**Custom Switches Using Sermon Component**

All of these switches are done in the config area, except some of these defaults which is added by the simple switches. For example the global timer, remember we spoke about the check-in. Here you can set it all whether it should be every 5 hours, 12 hours, once a day, every second day, once a week or never. Checking in your items automatically. The version control buttons are added automatically as well. Which means the person can set the version control 'on' or 'off'. [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m07s) and the number of records that should be set. If 'zero', then all versions will be saved. This is the version control. 

**Adding Contributors**

The author areas is also added automatically. When you click in the 'component' ,  [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m40s) you will see  a 'contributing area'. You can set whether you want to add 'empty contributor fields'. Here(see video) you can add contributors as many as you like, for instance those involved with developing your component and then the amount of empty ones you want to leave there. Its also tweakable. That will basically, add this area here (See video) contributor 1, 2, 3, 4.[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m09s) When you use this switch it controls whether it's been shown in the back or the front of all these kind of features. Which I am not going to go into much depth now. They also are added automatically, as well as the permissional structure . 

**Adding UIkit**

In the component you can actually set that it includes UIKit, set it to 'yes'. If you do that it[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m37s)  automatically adds this feature to your component and every where UIkit is used. So everything else, this Dropbox, preachers, preacher, categories, category, series list, and series and sermons is all done through that config area here(See video). 

**Adding Fields To Custom Config Fields**

To add fields to the config area, you first need to add that field to fields. [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m07s) You would go to fields and whatever field you want to use there, you need to create here(Fields). So you first create the fields. Then you need to remember the system name that you're using. Because then when you open up this(add) you would be able to type in the name and it will be selected. And then by convention that tab name as long as you use the same tab name it will be bundled in the order of which you set it here. [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m40s) It is in the Dropbox area where all their fields are being set. The reason why we include this demo component into the application with the tutorial, is that you can go and look and see he's using [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m00s) 'Dropbox update method' here. Then you can go look at this file. The 'Dropbox update method', the files, and the text, and even some of this 'Update listing Now!'. If I click it [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m23s) it starts an update. It even shows it here. How to do this is very tricky. It's not that simple to do that because we are not inside of our component, as you can see, we are actually in the config component in the global if you have global settings. This whole feature that is build into sermon distributor. [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m56s) You can look at these things in this list view. All the Dropbox information is there. There is some 'global' like, 'local folder', 'download link'. 

**Spacer HR Field In Component Fields**

Then there is 'spacer hr'. [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m24s) You can see that I have that 'spacer hr' quite often. It's a field that will be included in the paid version of component builder. It already has that 'spacer hr' in it, since you can use the same spacer over and over. The system automatically increment it, it doesn't have conflict in name conventions. I'm just using the same spacer every where. Putting spacers which is this little line [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m01s) you see that line there. It's very small but it gives a space between these areas. That is why I'm doing that. You can also put default values which will be used during installation of the component. If you have switches in your config that you want to populate with default values, you should just add those values here. [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m27s) Then during the install, those values will be added to the database and component builder puts all that in place for you. This(see video) is where you add the config fields. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<







**Tab - View Names Fields added to Site Menu**

And there is another convention which is maybe not that obvious, [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m51s) but I added a convention that if you use a tab name, which is exactly the same as a front end view then I will add this field to that front end views menu. 
[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m13s) If you think about Joomla's Content Manager, it does the same thing. In the global setting of your article manager you can set features for categories and for articles. But if you create a new article in a menu item, then you can overwrite those, you can say use global or you can overwrite them. This feature of using the same tab name, this features name is [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m48s) switch, preacher whether it should be a table or a grid. We set the default 2, and we called it preachers plural. That's quite important. Let's look at the front. Here I have a bunch of menus. [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m09s) I'm going to go to a menu that I've already created called preachers. And then I'm also going to go to components back end, called preachers. So you see there is a list of items. All I did in the component builder, is I simply added, the name preacher as a tab name. That's all I did and then the fields. There is the list of the fields(see video), from there to there. [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m41s) These fields I simply created in the field area with field types. It is some radio buttons. A drop down list, another drop down list, and again some radio buttons. These are the fields. Then in the view, if you click on sermon distributor, you will see those exact same fields. It has the option of using the global [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m07s) instead. There it says 'used global' or you can overwrite it. You can decide in this specific admin view if I want to use grid and not the global option. 

That whole system of adding this extra features to every item view of the front end, is integrated simply by a convention. If the front end is called preachers which in this case it is, as you can see there, it's called preacher, see I just selected a menu item called preachers. We haven't dealt with setting up your site views and all that so this might be [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m47s) how did you get that item name right in everything. But I'm trying to sketch a picture which we will revisit when we eventually get to this area. But just that you know from where it comes it's simply in the config. I added the files and used to convention of the actual front end page, it has a name called preachers. There is as well for preacher which is single. [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m15s) If I closed out, select sermon distributor and then select preacher. Which is another view. Then I clicked here(sermon distributor) you see all these switches. They are also mapped in here, from there all the way to there. They have some default values in there. There are the [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m43s) fields. In the back end of the component, if I click on preacher, here is the same fields. You can set global settings and then you can overwrite them in the menu itself by not using global. This whole feature is possible through this config little tab. It looks insignificant I suppose [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m08s) and you might not expect it like I said it's not that obvious that it does this, but that is what it is doing. And so as you can see all of those certain areas I just mapped it in config. Because of the name of the tab, let me stress that, because of the name of the tab, the system knows this is related to any front end menus as well. Therefore it will automatically create those front end things for you. 

**Site View Explanation Of Above Tabs**

Now to show you how it is done it's quite simple. [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m47s) Not that I want to teach you how the Joomla API works but I want you to at least know what is it doing. I'm going to go to the front of this component. I'm going to open that view, preachers. And you'd see in template, there is a extra file called Default XML. Then I'll open that default XML. All what component builder is doing, it is adding the convention to this file. [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m18s) If you're running into troubles and it's not working as you expected, this is the file in which you can come and look to see what's happening. That is in the front end. In views. In the specific view that you have, it must be this view, must be the tab name. In that file called default XML.  [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m41s) 

**Quick Explanation Of Creating Site Views**

This is important since we haven't dealt with adding site views. This site views here, I need to quickly touch on it, that you at least know something that relates to this. That is if you didn't click on add as a menu. If you sets it to 'no' then that file will not exist. That file only exist if this is set to 'yes'. So setting it to 'yes', [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m11s) tells component builder to build this default XML file, and setting the tabs to the same name as this view, tells component builder to add those fields to this field and make it so that your user can then have unique implementation. This is important. [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m34s) It doesn't make use of this information necessary inside of your site view. You need to make use of this information in your site view. 

## Using Of Parameters

If you're a developer you would expect that right you would know inside of your component, you have [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m56s) a place where you check params header. Should it show, then it shows it and you are getting it from the parameters. The parameters are set inside of the view.html.php. You see here we set the parameters. We do this 'app- get params'. This actually gets all the parameters in relation to this view. It gets that component parameters, it gets the menu parameters, and it automatically if it has the custom, [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m33s) if they've used global, it will automatically fall back on what is set here. Which is excellent. So you're using the same name, display and display. It's the same name. And so if you are using global, what parameters does, its getting this place, parameter. [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m02s) The display field is getting that parameter. It first looks at the menus settings and that one is set to global, it automatically falls back to the global settings. That is done by Joomla itself. It's not really something I build. It's just the way Joomla works, which is excellent. That means that by using params and then doing a check-up. This value is inside of 'this params'. [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m34s) And then I go to the default view and let's see where am I implementing some of that. Let's go to here the 'preacher display'. The field name wasn't just display I'm sorry it was called preachers display. That's the field name in the global configurations. [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m03s) If you're not with me it is what we used for this field - 'switch preacher tablegrid'. It's called preacher display. If I was to go and open this field you see the whole picture, 'switch preachers tablegrid'. Here is the list of the switch preachers [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m37s) fields. As you can see I'm in the fields tab. I'll open that specific field. And you'd see that the name of this field is preachers_display. [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m56s) You need to make sure that none of the fields have the same name. That is quite important. What I mean by none of the fields, I mean this(preacher) field must not be the same name as that(plain) field. Every field in this global area must be unique. It should never overlap. That is why I use the convention of preachers display so that I can also use preacher without the 's' display and I can use [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m25s) category_display in you see so that I have that site of convention of implementation. You should all around as you develop think about conventions using sort of logical repetitive scalable concepts. And so this is one of them that I've done. I just added it here. It's that specific item. And then in the global area you go to preachers. It is this field here(Display - Table - Grid - List). [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m59s) And in the code, if preacher_display = 1, then show the table. If preacher_display = 2, then show the grid. And if non is selected then show the list. Which is the three options if you look at the button. The button has table grid list. [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m21s) I'm not asking does the global have this or that, none of that, I'm just calling the field directly. Because the way that Joomla gets that initial data like I showed you here. They sort that out for you. That's quite nice. I've tested it and made sure that my explanation is the truth. So goes with the colors. You can see here I again I do 'this.>params.>get('preachers_tables_color') colors. But this is actually knowledge that you would have [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m55s) if you have developed a component for Joomla. You would know about these tricks. I'm just showing to you how component builder makes it easy to implement these kind of things. Which otherwise would take so much time to write this up and then make sure it's exactly the same inside of the XML folder menu and so forth. Component Builder does all of that out of this config file simply with a convention that relates to the actual front end. [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m26s) I think we have covered that thoroughly enough. That will be all for this tutorial. I will continue looking at more concepts of the component. And it's features. 

Possibly it might be ideal for us to [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m48s) stop here with the component and go look at setting up a custom admin view or setting up a site view. Yet I'm thinking you know if we go that route, It's going to take us on a very long road so the ideal with me. Let me sort of Dealt with some of this component features first and finish that. [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m12s) And then as soon as we've finished it, we'll jump into the custom very nice area of your front-end development and custom admin development. And then we will obviously be relating back to what we have discussed here as we go. So I've now looked at the setting tab and try to cover as much of this area as I can I didn't talk much about MySQL tweak. This is a very advanced feature and [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2WkTjNFjvo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m44s) you can know that what it really does if we have dummy data. You're able to exclude them through this area so that if you have different versions you will through this MySQL tweak. Be able to exclude certain information which I realize it's a little bit advance and so for most cases people will just not use this.
