# MAKING A PULL REQUEST AT JOOMLA COMPONENT BUILDER SNIPPETS


### Process of taking Committed Changes to the Forked Version

This is a demonstration of the process of taking your committed changes to the forked version. The 'vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder-Snippets' is used and not the master branch. If this is a little different for you, I (as the administrator of the master branch) would like to assist you if there is really a holdup. [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s) For the most part it will not be only me that will respond to issues but also other people out there involved in managing these Snippets.  

[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m05s)   NB. You should be able to after having done what has been explained in the previous tutorial too, update the snippets, get out a forked version of the repository, clone it down offline, and to unzip the package into that repository, update those files and commit those changes with messages. Then to push it up here after you have ensured that your branch is in sync with the upstream branch. If you do not understand, please go back, watch that tutorial, it is the previous one in the playlist on YouTube.[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m40s)
 
### Your Messages Was Committed

[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m43s)

This one will be the first step of doing a pull request. Once you are in your repository on GitHub and you have to push your changes up here, you'll see the message 'This branch is 4 commits ahead of vdm-io:master.'  and be able to click on Pull request. We've done that. 

### Identifies If Forked

[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m08s)

Next thing it will open a page where it identifies that you have forked vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder-Snippets. Master branch as the base. There's only one branch at the moment. Then your head of the fork that you've got is over here. [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m38s) If it's says to you that it's 'Able to do a merge', then you're in good shape everything shouldn't be more complicated. You can see that those commit messages you've made are showing up here and exactly every change that was done. You will see we changed it from Layout to Tables. [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m03s) It shows you that we've renamed it from FooTable - (Layout) FooTable.json - FooTable - (Table) FooTable.json. It identified that for us. We can see nothing of the Snippets have changed. You can scroll and see the snippet isn't changed, only Layout and Table and the date. Which is good for we want to be able to see when was the last change to the file. We can see that usage has a new [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m30s) description added. That means if I was to click on the link 'Added the accordion snippet', click there '788fc92' you will see that's exactly what he did. Added accordion snippet, and the same goes for every one of these commit messages. That's what I meant when I said giving good commit messages [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m56s) will make it so much easier for us to review the changes and to make sure that it is correct. If it is very complicated and difficult usually this kind of pull request will take longer. 

### Commit Smaller Amount of Snippets Instead Of Bulk

[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s)

Doing smaller amounts of snippet contributions in of stead of whole bulk I suppose would be better, unless you already a trusted member in the community then I'll suppose it will go easier. If you haven't done any of these before, maybe take smaller steps at first  until we get to know you and until we are more confident that you are a good contributor to do this project. Trust is important for us so we'll be able to check this. No pull request has yet been made. 

### Click On Create Pull Request - Summarize Pull Request

[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m41s) 

We've just come to the page of where it starts. You need to click on this create pull request. This will open in an area which you should give us information of what would sort of summarize this pull request. If it's like a new library, let's say 3, 4, 5, snippets to a new library, then just put that as the title. Whatever would be enough to give those that needs to review this just enough information to know what's happening and what's coming in, especially if there is some [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m23s) specific detail. That we will in time add some documents to this repository which will give you demo names and stuff in this field, so that you will know what to put in there. That will still come. 

### Title - Demonstration Of Snippet Contribution

[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m43s)

I'm just going to say: Demonstration of snippet contribution. I don't think you'll be able to make changes here. It's only the admin that has the ability to add in Reviewer, Assign, Label, Project and Milestone. That will be the responsibility of the admin. They might not do it. They might feel I will just merges and we don't need to make much fuss of it, but if it's a big contribution and they need to be some real [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m22s) work done, we must probably make use of these tools. 

### Description - Use Commit Messages

[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m27s)

The description, we could either just use the commit messages as the description, or like I said that which we will maybe setup in the future. We will then create the pull request and just give another glance and say: everything is fine, click 'Create pull request'. We now have the pull request and here is where we as the admin will get involved. You cannot really take it further and rightly because we want to protect this repository. We want to make sure only good  [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) well-documented, well explained, well named, snippets are contributed. Once you have come to this point, you'll have to wait for one of our admin to get back to you and if they have issues, they will start discussing it with you. Ask questions and please we want to [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m40s) protect you and protect everyone else. So don't be upset if they have questions. In fact be glad that they would that will ensure that all of us will enjoy this infrastructure. Once everything is satisfied and everyone is happy there will be some reviewers that will sign off on this pull request. [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m05s) At this stage if we have two reviewers sign off on it, at least then we can merge it into the master branch. 

### Different Ways To Merge Into The Master Branch

[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m19s)

Now there are different ways on how the merging into the master branch is done. This is mostly related and I'm doing this part mostly for the admin, who may need to be able to do this. You could do it here on GitHub. Just click 'Merge pull request'. Since there is no conflicts, if there are conflicts then it gets more complicated  and usually we will need more advanced admin guys who knows Git better to maybe in a command line be able to resolve some of this. 

### Command Line Instructions

[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m54s)

You can click on 'command line instructions' link and it will show you the command line way of dealing with it. Or you could select one of these various emerging options. All of that I'll explain more in a tutorial that's just specifically directed [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m12s) at the further steps that is necessary for admins. Where us regarding you as a contributor, this is really where you end and we take over. We want to tell you that once the contribution is accepted and it's merged in, then it will again become visible [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m35s) in JCB, in the Snippet Get area, which we demonstrated when we started out giving an overview of how things work. And really that's what it's about, it's really all of this complexity that we've now discussed, is not the main focus. 

### Focus - Managing Snippets

[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m52s)

The focus is to enable us to enlarge the Snippet area without really intruding bond constant updates in database tricks to share the Snippets. But instead have this easy way of maintaining a GitHub repository. Which in effect will then be accessible via the JCB Get area. When you can add new Snippets. You can obviously delete Snippets, [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m24s) and going to the Snippets area. You can come in Snippets and click Accordion and Trash the snippet. Then go to Trashed and completely delete the snippet(Accordion) from your repository which will then cause the snippet to [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m45s) be seen as non existent in your Snippets area. There are ways to remove duplicates. I don't want to go into a very long explanation again on how Snippets area works. But our expectation is that some of you would feel I want to contribute, Share Snippets with the rest of the community and in the same time get your name out there. Since looking at the files changed, [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m14s) you will see that this new snippet, it looks like it just did what it's been doing, because my name is on most of these, is because I added them and that's why my name is on there. You are also able to add your name in here because you are adding Snippets and that's really the idea. [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m37s) I'm looking forward to seeing all of you getting involved in this area as well.
