Snippets Master branch As the base there's only one branch at the moment And Then Your head Of the fork that you've got is over here [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m38s) And if it's says to you that it's able to do a merge Then You're in good shape everything shouldn't Be more complicated You also now see that those commit messages you've made Are now actually also showing up here And exactly every change that was done so basically you see we changed it From layout To tables And it [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m03s) shows you that we've renamed it from this to that So it actually identified that for us And if we can see ok nothing of the Snippets have changed You can scroll and see the snippet Isn't changed only those and the date Which is good for we want to Be able to see when was the last change to the file Here we can see that usage had A new [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m30s) Description added So that means if I was to now actually click On this link Added the accordion snippet Click there You see ok that's exactly what he did added accordion snippet And The same goes for every one of these commit messages And that's really what I meant when I said Giving good commit messages [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m56s) You make it so much easier for us to review the changes And to make sure that it is correct If it is very complicated and difficult Usually this kind of pull request will take longer So doing smaller amounts of snippet Contributions in of stead of whole bulk I suppose Would be Better Unless you already a trusted member in the community then I'll suppose it will go easier So yeah if you haven't done any of these before maybe take smaller steps at first [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m29s) Until we get to know you and until we more Confident that you Are a good contributor to do this project Yeah so trust is important for us So we'll be able to check this now no pull request has yet been made We've just come to the Page of where it starts You actually need to click on this create pull request This will now open in area Which You should give us information [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m59s) Of What would sort of summarise This pull request So if it's like a new library let's say 3 4 5 snippets to a new library Then just put that as the title Whatever would be enough To actually give those That needs to review This just enough information to know what's happening And what's coming in specially If there is some [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m23s) Specific detail now I know That we will In time at some Documents to this repository Which will give you sort of Demo Names and stuff in this field So that you will know what to put in there So that will still come so for now I'm just gonna say Illustration of snippet contribution [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m50s) Now I don't think you'll be able to make changes here It's only the admin that actually has the ability to actually add a reviewer And Assign a label and A project that a milestone And so that will be the responsibility of the admin They might not do it They might feel I will just merges and we don't need to make much fuss of it But if it's a big contribution and they need to be some real you know [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m22s) Work done here We must probably make use of these tools The description We could either just use the Commit messages as the description All like I said That which we will maybe set up in the In the future We will now then create the pull request And [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m47s) Just given another glance and say ok everything is fine and click create pull request When I now have the pull request and really here Is where we as the admin Will now get involved You cannot really take it further And Rightly so because we want to Protect this repository We wanna make sure only good ....... [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s) Well-documented, Well explained, well named, Snippets are contributed And so once you have come to this point You'll have to wait for one of our admin To get back to you and actually If they have issues they will start discussing it with you Ask questions And please We wanna just [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m40s) Protect you and protect everyone else So don't Be upset if they have questions In fact be glad that they would That will ensure that all of us Will enjoy this infrastructure So Once everything is satisfied and everyone is happy There will be some reviewers that will sign off On this pull request [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m05s) And I think at this stage if we have two reviewers sign off on it At least Then we can merge it into the master branch Now there are different ways on how the merging into the master branch is done This is mostly related and I'm doing this part mostly for the admin Who may need to be able to do this You could do it here on GitHub Just click merge pull request Since there is no conflicts If there is conflicts then it gets more complicated [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m41s) And usually we will need more advanced admin Guys who knows Git better Two maybe in a command line Be able to resolve some of this You can click on this link here and it will show you the command line Way of dealing with it Or You could select One of these various emerging options Now all of that I'll explain more in editorial that's just specifically directed [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m12s) At the further steps that is necessary for admins Where us regarding You as a contributor This is really where you end And We take over Now Wanna tell you that Once the contribution is accepted and it's merged in Then it will again become visible [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m35s) In JCB In the snippet get area Which we demonstrated when we started out giving an overview of how things work And really that's what it's about it's really all of this complexity that we've now discussed Is Not the main focus The Focus is to Enable us to Enlarge the snippet [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m58s) Area Without Really intruding Upon constant updates in database tricks to share the Snippets But instead have this easy way of Maintaining a GitHub repository Which in Effect will then be accessible via the JCB get area When you can add new Snippets You can obviously delete snippets [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m24s) Just going to the Snippets area You can come in there and click here and trash a snippet And Then go to Trashed And here Completely delete the snippet from your repository Which will then Cause the snippet to [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m45s) Be seen as non existent in your snippets area And so there are ways to remove duplicates And I don't wanna go into a very long explanation again On how to get Snippets area works But Our expectation is that some of you would feel yeah I wanna contribute Share Snippets with the rest of the community and in the same time Get your name Out there since looking at the files changed [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m14s) You see that this new snippet As Yeah it looks like it just did what it's been doing you now because my name is on most of these What is because I added them And that's why my name is on there And so You are now also able to Add your name in here because you are adding Snippets And that's really the idea Well [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-yxVtc-Co&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m37s) So we come to the end of this tutorial Thank you for watching And I'm looking forward to seeing all of you getting involved In this area as well
