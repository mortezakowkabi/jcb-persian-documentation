Demonstrate to you The process of now taking You're committed changes to your forked version But this one Not the master branch How is gonna be little different for you because of course I am a Administrator of the master branch So I'll see things that you maybe won't see But Moreless you should be able to actually make a pull request And If you're not able to please let us know Sure I can Make sure that you're able to Do that And There there R&B will be more guys involved in managing these Snippets So it's not only myself that will be responding to issues But 4 most part if there is really a holdup I'll come in and help Make sure that everything Works as we expect So you should be able to after having Done What is explained in the previous tutorial below Updating the snapper it's getting out a fault version Of the repository Toning it down offline And then basically it Unzipping the package into that repository Updating OS files committing those changes with messages And then pushing it up here after you have ensured that your branch is in sync with the upstream branch Ok That if you don't understand Please go back watch that tutorial is the previous one the playlist On YouTube And then this one now Will be First steps Basically I'm off doing a pull request So once you are in your repository on GitHub And you Push your changes up here you'll see this you know Message And be able to click on Pull request So We've done that Next thing it will open a page Where Basically Identifies That you have forked VDM On the Square - IO for Joomla component Builder Snippets Master branch As the base there's only one branch at the moment And Then Your head Of the fork But you've got is over here And if it's says to you that it's able to do a merge Then You're in good shape everything shouldn't Be more complicated You also now see that those commit messages you've made Are now actually also showing up here And exactly every change that was done so basically you see we changed it From layout Two tables And weed That shows you that we've renamed it from this Do that Sorry the actually identified that for us And if we can see ok nothing of the Snippets have changed You can scroll and seopela snippet Isn't changed only those and the date Which is good for money Be able to see that what When was the last change to the file Here we can see that usage had A new Description added So that means if I was 2 now actually click On this link Add it according snippet Click there You see ok that's exactly what he did Hadeda call you and snippet And The same goes for every one of these commit messages And that's really what I meant when I said Giving good commit messages You make it so much easier for us to review the changes And to make sure that it is correct If it is very complicated and difficult Usually this kind of pull request will take longer So doing smaller amounts of snippet Contributions of Stead of hold back I suppose Would be Better Unless you already a trusted member in the community then I'll suppose it will go easier So yeah if you haven't done any of these before maybe take smaller steps at first Until we get to know you and until we more Confident that you Are a good contributor to do this project Yeah so trust is important for us So we'll be able to check this now no pull request has yet been made We've just come to the Page of where it starts You actually need to click on this create pull request This will now open in area Which You should give us information Of What would sort of summarise This pull request So if it's like a new library let's say 345 slippage to a new library Then just put Paris the title Whatever would be enough To actually give those That needs to review This enough information to sonoff the bad know what's happening And what's coming in specially If there is some Specific detail now I know That we will In time at some Documents to this repository Which will give you sort of Demo Names and stuff in in in this field So that you will know what to put in there So that will still come so often now just gonna say Illustration of snippet contribution Now I don't think you'll be able to make changes here It's only the admin that actually has the ability to actually add a reviewer And Assign a label and A project that a milestone And so that will be the responsibility of the admin They might not do it They might feel I will just merges and we don't need to make much fuss of it But if it's a big contribution and they need to be some real Heroes Work done here We must probably make use of these tools The description We could either just use the Commit messages as the description Or like I said That which we will maybe set up in the In the future We will now then create the pool request And Just given another glance and say ok everything is fine and click create pull request When I was a pull request and really here Is where we as the admin Will now get involved You cannot really take it further And Rightly so because we want to Protectors repository We wanna make sure only good Hero Well-documented Will explain wall named Snippets are contributed And so once you have come to this point You'll have to wait for one of our admin To get back to you at actually If they have issues they will start discussing it with you Ask questions And please We wanna just Protect you and protect everyone else So don't Be upset if they have questions In fact be glad that they would That will ensure that all of us Will enjoy this infrastructure So Once everything is satisfied and everyone is happy There will be some reviewers that will sign off On this pull request And I think at this stage if we have to review or sign off on it At least Then we can you know virgin into the master branch Now there are different ways on how the merging into the master branch is done This is mostly related and I'm doing this part mostly for the admin Who may need to be able to do this You could do it here on get up Just click merge pull request Since there is no conflicts If there is conflict then it gets more complicated And usually we will need more advanced admin Guys who knows get better Two maybe in a command line Be able to resolve some of this You can click on this link here in all show you the command line Way of dealing with it Or You could select One of these various emerging options Now all of that I'll explain more in editorial that's just specifically directed At the further steps that is necessary for admins Where is regarding You as a contributor This is really where you end And We take over Now Wanna tell you that Once the contribution is accepted and it's merged in Then it will again become visible In JCP In the snippet get area Which we demonstrated when we started out giving an overview of how things work And really that's what it's about it's really all of this complexity that we've now discussed Is Not the main focus The Focus is to Enable us 2 Enlarge the snippet Area Without Really intruding Upon constant updates in database tricks to win in Euro share the Snippets But instead have this easy way of Maintaining a GitHub repository Which in Effect will then be accessible via the JCB get area When you can add new Snippets You can obviously delete snap it's Just going to the Snippets area You can come in there and click here and trash a snippet And Then go to Trashed And here Completely delete the snippet from your repository Which will then Cause the snippet 2 Be seen as non existent in your surface area And so there are ways to remove duplicates And I don't wanna go into a very long explanation again On how to get Snippets area works But Our expectation is that some of you would feel Hello yeah I wanna contribute Share Snippets with the rest of the community and in the same time Get your name Out there since looking at the files changed You see that this new snippet As Yeah it looks like it just did what it's been doing you now because my name is on most of these What is because I added them And that's why my name is on there And so You are now also able to Add your name in here because you are adding Snippets And that's really the idea Well So we come to the end of this tutorial Thank you for watching And I'm looking forward to seeing all of you getting involved In this area as well
