Ok let's do this Mowana and a File Field Good component And upload a file So I I'm gonna use this demo component He's got a few at nephews who got the errors Look I got a side view looks And looking I'm gonna add this field to do look Admin View But I first need to create the field And We need to sort of look at The steps that will need to implement Currently JCB doesn't matter the box actually Address this We might think of doing this Maybe The future but Because of some of the security risks It's actually best you do this is self Because then At least you uncle Control And the risk is Really yours Adult How to put anyone else address Ok So you're uploading a file The field you wanna use already exists In the Sorry if you types So we got the field types There is a field called File See where is it Must be none Yeah we go File Now this Obviously Everything in here Was taken From Zuma Las documentation So it shows you a whole lot of attributes their values some of the description But also shows you where to actually get more info on this And so it's always good To actually do that Ok so here we are Scroll down And there is the file field So It actually now has this new except Perimeter Which is nice Extra which wasn't available when I first set it up So if yours doesn't have it You see that I Actually Have Since I did it It's not Ok so Midas As well add it now then So you're on the size it's at that new attributes So it's accept The value of gonna leave it to being image and can be changed 5 give it some Affirmation is regarding The scripture that Present I'm here ok so We got this new attribute set Those of you running the latest Release of JCB Might already have this there it only gets added if you do fish install It doesn't update the database Ok great 7 clothes So we got our file type set If we go to files now And we can Create a new file Sorry field I-Traffic Files I mean Fuel And we select the file Come on You see that it gives you the Information And there is that new Attribute Available to us And you'll see that it's also showing up here And so this is the beginning Of actually setting up The File field type Deponent I'm just gonna call this file And Then here we can just say File Well let's call it image Here we say image to take me to computer And most of these other values we could actually take away Will come back to this Once we've added to the component and started looking Hot Found the other things that must be done because this is only step a they are actually 3 steps to take Of which this is the easiest So we have here Image Need to say that this Close ok now we go to our rapid View And that's this Look I'm gonna go directly to it fields So could you said that File Fuel type Little bit Chunk in here's I'm gonna Zoom out a bit Ok Where will I place this They are Two tabs I think let's do it in the more areas At the bottom here More And Image and we'll see there are quite a few files here Image Thank you Tile Africa And That should do it Let's make it forward For now And then one Just 1 and 7 close so now If we What open the atom View We should see the new Field has been added And it is said to being in the full view Sorry full width of the The club In the more tab And We could actually now compile the car Component As it has a beginning to see ok how I was gonna workout Powder And then Install it Then have a look at it It's a great new demo Go to more So here we see The file So it's telling us File one Ok we have a weather problem here We've got to 2 mm Fields with the same name image So I'll have to go change this Can I go back I'm gonna uninstall this Is gonna be the easiest way to do that And then go back To the fields Corset Last one I'm created End Image And it's strange this 2 Banner Think that'll be ok Not the type Ok so I think we'll use banner I'm weak all this also banner so it stays the field type is file but will use the Label banner ANN7 close Now let's try again You know if you have Two of the same fields Meaning exactly the same name JCB automatically calls the one The name with being image one the other one image two And doing that is not good practice it usually doesn't come out right in Events Busy with history Because it only tracking one field right And When it actually takes the history that field name doesn't match any field So So when it comes to the history and updating of the database Automatically as you add new fields Using the same field multiple times is not recommended ok So let's try this again And then install it Now if we go and have a look We should see a different Reality here great Banner Got all the necessary information Obviously this is set And your server Tells you that And now you can click here and select a Image So I'm gonna do that So I got this autumn tree forest that I've selected And Need to add a name and some That seems to be all I need to do and then save and we have a problem NOSA A little glitch that I love you should have I Tampered with some of the Validations In a previous day Pretoria Anyway Now I fixed it and As you can see When I saved the item It actually Didn't upload anything So the file is not in my system And that's where usually All of you would sort of Ok so you've used file EUFA Selected there Banner whatever you wanted to upload And it just nothing happened and that's because There needs to be a server side Which needs to actually validate the file Move the file and check the file everything Make sure that it's a correct file Secure the file And then place the files path back in Into this Field When it puts the value in there by And it's that process which is to be custom code Ok so let's go back to our component and let's do it What are the things I like to do before I actually start coding anything Cos rule look Under the hood look at what's going on especially if it's the first time I'm doing it so So many of you this might be your first time I'm gonna show you someone how this is done and it's Like inspecting what's going on Under The Hood and how can I use it So I'm gonna open this item again and I'm going to again select our Image And then having the image selected I'm gonna go to the code So I know where the code is for this website right so I'm gonna go into my editor and I'm going to the Admin area office component and off this View Model Into where it actually saves the values so Follow Me Follow Me There So here we have the component without this one that one to my mouth then An administrator components demo And then models and look I wanna go there Double click on go to open and you could just go to almost the bottom of the file somewhere there Look for the safe Method Function really That's where we wanna sort of pork because It's at this point where all the data from the browser is available to us and And we should be able to access it now you could ride the helper class and put it in your helper function And use the same uploading sort of Class if you want to reuse it but you could also scripted writing here and I'll show you how to do it that way Obviously I like reusing scripts so the helper class I beer is more appealing because I put it there and everywhere I Are used as field Type For fire uploading I just also use this helper class to deal with moving the data and using it Ok so for now What we gonna do as we gonna ride down some values just to the screen When we click save in the UI to see what happened so Let's do that So basically two One is the actual data that is available here and the other is this we getting the Input Trust And I'm gonna Check in files what do we have there I am the input of the application and if so Ok we can save this changes then Go back to the The website And basically just click save Ok so now we got a a dump if yours doesn't look like this it might be because you do not have Xdebug install on your server You would turn 12 at some sort of Formatting Something like this Echo Free Just to sort of add some formatting their balls into one line Ok I don't need that I've got extra bug so it does it for me Ok so now we here we have the data and we see that our Where is it Baby it's not even in the data list but that's ok Just crawled down you see we dumped a different set of data and it actually it was Scroll a little We'll see that has a protected value called a form name type temporary Name error size Overcome information then in the temple name and has The actual file name Banner with its temporal occation so it creates a temporal look Patient for the file A thousand type is image.jpg and also gives us the file name And so this is the array would you want to actually get hold of and With whom you would want to yes make changes Move that image Give it it correct name back after validating it and doing whatever sanitation is required And then saving that value back into the banner data position Which should be in the first array here but it is It isn't there But it should be here So you should actually just create it Ok so going back to the code let's do some of that There is a nice Get function here We can just say Jay form if you remember that was where the data is and if we want all the values back Bakkies under a or that it should be nice if there is none existing So we gonna save that and then Just upload the file again to see You know how does it look now Have to do it again because of previous values are actually gone So we'll stick save again and Larry go we've get a little different array But more useful An easier to pass And now we can take the next step to actually check the disarray exist There is a function already or a class in Joomla which already does All of this for you In fact I would say let's go look at that and let's just copy some of those functions Impact that's copy the function and adapted to our needs and just put it into Our our class so in components you go to the Installer then the model and then uninstall Scroll down to see one that says get package from Load Frank is what it says yeah get package from upload This is the function which is really ideal for the task It takes care of a lot of sanitizing it has little chicks in it and it should Should be Yeah it should be useful for us in this case we'll obviously take some stuff Way and our own little messages so we don't depend on the installers Messages so we'll just copy this whole function all the way up there Control copy it go to look our class And for now I'm just gonna paste it in here above There are some key things I would like to change here for example I'm thinking let's It stains a function name and recorded My Upload function For now And We we gonna pass it the input So we don't want that To be done twice And We know that this is going to be Jay form and we definitely don't want to have raw Because it's an image We want this to be a Rea So we can actually check the values And then This looks fine We can stay here Upload Sorry up Road Ring Images Not Available now wait and set uploads are not enabled in PHP that seems fine Ok we can actually take these messages and put them in here because JCB is gonna grab this France we put it into our component Gonna add it to all language files for all component and this is really wanna make sure that that happens We don't need the lip because we not gonna on zip anything So we could actually move this part Now there is gonna check where we actually got a file set of files here so It's got a check with her that User file is an array And if it's not I want to say if I was not know if I was selected or no Why was uploaded so we can just type that in If at this point we detect any errors we basically want to Throw raise those errors and actually break out of this upload So let's see Upload error warning upload error I suppose we need to go look at these language strains in the lung Language file off installer to correctly translate this For now I'm not gonna do that so I'm just gonna say ever You can get I do that on your own Ok now what we wanna take you is All Upload size you want to make sure that our upload size is what we expected Is the maximum field size too small in the php.ini and that's really what What's happening here and so again it will give an error saying File too large I got the same here It's tracking again this time it's first check whether it's in the fire knife while here is actually check the file size Data is a file size And so we can again say Upload error again you should just check what is the actual file language string And replace that with the English version here Ok then We Built appropriate bath We take the filename great the path we used to be great this temporal s r See which is source bath And then we Move the file with the J file upload This point the file is being uploaded to the server And they are storm validation still to do in our Script with me actually Just grabbed from the app loader class We do this impact now we don't need and pack we wanna do some other things here Which are More appropriate for our purpose First thing I'm gonna Actually move the get classes function up a few lines And also make sure to have the folder class actually available in case Then I'm going to clean the name So that it is everything is fine and well it anywhere later we might not have any Ok so then we still have what we did here before This actually is going to be replaced with little function Which I sort of started writing called Check upload I'm gonna change this function as one of my own Sort of functions which I've already adapted For other projects and The past The mike you've seen Remove this one out That one can stay like that So Are we here We are going to just do a little check-up to actually make sure that the package Which we are actually going to Give back and which were used to store in a database and all the rest is actually you know AFK 3 here we just gonna grab the result of this which basically be true or false and we gonna check it If it's Falls we gonna say No something like upload Failed And Then If we still going We going to actually do this check So now we've got this check upload in place And we first gonna get the format from the file And then we going to use a little Custom script here to validate our format I've got a In my component I usually set formats that I allow So it's a global Same That means In your component you would have to actually go in and add config Drop down With a list of Allowed Formats now Do sort of sidestep that in Instead of find Esplanade Explain all that I'm just going to go and remove this Function here you could You know pause this and copy that down if you know what I'm talking about the That case You don't need to pause this you know how to type it I'm so I'm gonna remove that And you sad You know some format was I think ok I'm I'm ok with this JPEG I'm ok with that format and I'm also gonna be ok with JPG Ok I'll be there At the top there Palm And Maybe GIF BMG And then GIF So those are the formats that I'm Gonna say yeah There's a fine of course because it's really the file extension that we are checking you right So we not gonna use a global value here we just gonna use the file format Allow file formats And then here would basically gonna check Is this file format in this array If it's not We gonna say Invalid file Format I never go and is gonna ever out but with this error out we will ne Need to do some house cleaning So Will have to look at that at the moment So what I think I'll do is I'm going there also pass it the destination of where we've moved the file And Then Because that's where the file currently is right So here we got the temporal destination which is really In the Tempo passa Temple folder of the Joomla website it's not where we want to end up It's just where we gonna keep the fire until we happy that it's safe It's ok I got it in the temple there's the nation with moved it up there And now We protected something happened yet fine Check the upload And Here If we leave now Find The dis Actual file Is Problematic we gonna have to remove it Forgot have a renewal class year And then we gonna say more remove It's a file I think that's right And we gonna write this will remove file in a moment Ok so let's say for a reason you'll see here got a lot of Validation whether the user actually has permission to upload stuff Now that again I'm I'm gonna remove that from now because Yeah It's gonna be a little bit Beyond the scope of what we're explaining Now I want to pass a package back Which We are happy with Saying This is actually where our file is And what its name is And So we gonna just do that So that's the directory And that is the package name And we gonna Pass that back As the package We could Since we've got the Format And maybe you wanna store that We could also add that to the Rain So There we go everything is good Got the package name directory path as well as the format and will return that back As the package And we give that back To the model The safe function Is going to call this so in the save function we gonna go This Year of yes we said We are going to Has it The input Field The input value since we're really getting it why get it again so we gonna pass that over here See something like That ok That looks good So Now all that needs to be done is over here instead of this Function We can now do The following This My upload function And the import Have you got So I will actually end up with that package in Formation of right in this variable And we can then just exit out to see how that will look And even if you've got some typo errors here Oh yes we still need to create remove far if we have a Crazy why do we need to remove the file Well all the way up to hear the father is actually not on the server It is somewhere in memory Somewhere in limbo And If something happens And we returned Falls here we don't need to do anything it's not really anywhere it's just gonna do Disappear Same with it Happening here or there Or any of these other areas before here But the moment we do this We are actually moving the file to the server And it is now if that is true it is on the server I'm so when we pass the destination and the filename here to check upload We ready have the file on the server And so if we then discuss this cover that this file is not legit we don't want it we must remove it Or any other chicks we do Even if it's something more complicated than this You must remove it Because it's on the server And so I will remove function I'm trying to save a song Summer Unnecessary Thanks I'm gonna also super it up a bit because we're ready up here We got the classes for the file in a folder so we don't need to load that again We going to pass at the destination Which is the folder And We gonna That's gonna be fine So All of us we are able to Actually Get out and hey we don't need this we just need to pack 3 here we gonna ask is it a file Then delete then if there's something not right we gonna do clean paraffin just checking Again and delete in this should remove The file From The server You can test that if something's wrong just Google it And Cricket but this should be ok So we gonna basically pass it The destination path Which is the one to where we moved it Remember Appear So that's the same path we are passing all the way down to the remove Function and then It will clear it out for us I'm in if everything is fine and it doesn't need to We gonna continue on and then bus it back here To the package Which will be returned 2 hour Save Method So all of this code that I just wrote here now I'll take it and dump it on get out as a kiss So you could go there all L give the A link to it but if this is Quickly code it I mean I'm sure that you could improve it Wikipedia pasted stuff from other You know other classes To sort of get this working but there's nothing really to extravagant here the only thing Yeah that we didn't go into his exactly what does clean do and what does apply do and Those kind of things but you can obviously go through the tumor libraries Exactly what does it do But for the most part it's just in a wreck HP Functionality And so yes That it would be enough To actually upload the file So let's give it a spin So we back over here if we Click on this it will actually take us out of the Item so we can just click the back there then name And we would have again to select the actual image so there we have the the image And we can click save And see what happens whips we gotta bounce it is here A Galaxy undefined index undefined index we've got trouble Let me go see why Ok so I didn't take Rosie Tension here I'm just gonna do another one down Take the exact way to sort us possibly need to do a for each It might want to upload more than one But Or we could force it to just use the first I think I wrote something about this Already somewhere let me just check I think this should do the trick If it's an array we just wanna grab the first value out of the array If you got multiple Fields That are uploading files In the same view you gonna have to change this little chunk Because then you gonna have to deal with each others Files In a footage loop inside of this function Which basically would mean you could Skip all these as they are Global to everyone of them and then from about Yes from about here You would add a for each loop Because you would Ok and then here you won't Echo well you won't break out you just grab the error into an array Wish you would have been chilly then pass More Targeting specific package Really And then return Here The older successes as well as the areas and handle it somewhere else So since we just uploading one file I'm not gonna You know Do all that just gonna grab that First Value and we gonna work with that first value in that should do it Ok let's go back and try again Save Again we have a problem Not user files Use a file Sorry Use a file Is a file Come so Littles Changes like that can Throughout Arizona And at last we actually have The file on the server What I had to do is hard to take away these points here I had that was Bought wrong so don't need the actual point and actually To be without it and you'll see that now there is a file in our 10 Pro for the it is actually The server and and also we have the path And we have the name And all those things Impact Everything now is Is good we can now move File To its final location now we could deal with moving the file To its final location Here in our Save class Or we can again have another Function Which we passed this Value to which then moves the file to where we would want every image Found 2go Ok let me quickly type that out here and I'll package Got the file name so that's Really important And we got the full path which is where the file currently is And what is It's formatted We could actually have more values in this if we wanted we could do something like this Instead of just passing That use a filename And name Was it the whole The whole array Like that and then here we change that to archive And Then here we do Fat Which actually means we've got this array 2 hour You know it's available So instead of doing check we can then do Package name And then Endure And Format And Return the archive package Now we'll have all the information which we actually were using even up Here will have all of that information to our disposal Scores also need to Shames this 2 The Hub Well you know what the name is already there Set of package name We can just be satisfied with the name Ok and then we could cool call this 4 Full Pass Yes So that would be the in any only information that we are adding notes really new with these two values So we can just do that An hour a looks so full It's got the type the temporal regional temporal The longer they are Any errors that might have come up The size of the File the full path and the format So we got all those information to to use now at the end of the day the only information we really gonna Keep is up to us We could decide to skip the size of the file We could decide to keep it for me it is really up to us And really I'm not gonna go into how to deal with all that we just have one Name Field of How use a column In the database called Bana In which we are to place our final Information and that information should be a You know the path in in relation to The image folder Where we have Placed this This file The First I'm going to get some Konstanz to use I like this Using this route As that is Always going to be the root path To our website And then next actually add Just the path to the images Where we going to place our m So I'm gonna copy this So we going to just Add The path the relation to the root folder to the banner In the database Now You do realise that this is actually just for you it's so did you know where the file is later You will then on the front end of the site where you gonna use this value You have to When you get the value from the database you'll still need to create The Actual image html tag To actually load the image or whatever you gonna do with this file You're gonna still have the code that nothing of that's gonna be done Are you gonna just at least have the path to exactly where the father is because you're storing it that way in the Banner Common that's the field Ok And now here we taking the root path And that exact value And we are moving The full path which we build-up here right which is the actual current destination We are going to move it from the full path to the Final Destination And that is really yet At this point We got the image on the server And We are moving it to the correct location And we are storing the value In the database And we've done with saving and uploading the actual value As Yes that would be all that's required Now In any of these steps You might wanna be more Yeah do some more things be more secure be more validating Because it's not only images your obviously going to be uploading if you uploading PDF If you uploading other kind of content You gonna have to do some Googling to anywhere in these steps Especially in this check upload area To do the correct validation because at this point the file is on your server And you need to make sure that it's the right file Now this isn't Airtight Because this really just Checks that the files type Is one of these The extension It doesn't actually valid data File to really being an image They are more Secure ways to To do that But some of them are little bit more Yeah if you do use them the server side You know If you have to Keisha is gonna be running And shared environments Then it will cause problems because some of those functions are not available in all Environment But if you wanna be Like very specific You could actually help the user along to who uses your application to Enable those functions on their server And by that giving them extra Security with uploading of files This is obviously a very big topic Which I don't think we have time to go into in that dept But in general this sort of implementation is really how most are doing it And yet Yeah Let me know sir Get too too concerned This should be ok Now We have moved everything in place let's give her a trial run So it says that it's been saved to excessively But No file selected is shown here Now we might want to Show The file that is now currently in the database Instead of this upload or Show the upload still but let's say someone decides to upload another one that it Actually changes it And remove the old one and adds the new one And displays the little image here As it is in the database now let's first see is it in the database Ok so here in the database we see there is our file And it is actually said to be in images autumn trees forest Building grass Dot JPG that is where it is Ok now let's see if it actually was moved To that Place So here in the folder structure we gonna open images we gonna click here on images then Scroll down C David is autumn tree You can see it there If it is in its place So the actual image does now Exist in the image folder It is been uploaded and it actually is in the database also Our little snippet there says that it can't be no Before we continue with that kind of custom scripting we need to take what we have done so far And actually added to JCB We've done and in the year i d e And if we compile in in Store this component now You actually override everything you've written And boom it's gone So what to do Let's go grab that custom scripting and added to the component In JCB Cause we wanna grab everything From Upload my uploads function You wanna do check upload And remove file all of that we want to get So we gonna say cut And Got that in the The board Then go to JCB And in the look at Man view which is where all this is happening we can open up Then there is a place called custom buttons You gonna say yes here And then there is the controller method when I adding anything there But here is the The model method And so this is a place for us to actually add Subscript to the model And we gonna just paste what we've got Out Write in here And overhearing the list control over not adding anything Also in this this car Controller not adding anything So we basically just adding that Which we threaten to the model method at your PSP here is gonna go into the As methods so This is the methods That's a method That is obviously a method All of these are methods We want it to be available to the class Now on We are not actually at this point dealing With if you upload a new file that it removed the old one That should still Be further custom Scripting And so this point all Just add the new file it won't Remove the old one So could be that he's adding more files and more files and it just gets added to the image folder But it's not being removed You have the remove Profile function already here So you could actually yeah you could actually fix this quite easily But I'm not gonna show you how to do that I wanna encourage you to Study up some of your Bitch be as well Now Here we need to also add obviously The Script that we are adding to the save method so here is the PHP safe method Before data modelling this is where we want to actually Jump In And like it says there the value stored in the data array So we just gonna go back to the idea And scroll down to Sorry this What's up Just gonna scroll up To this Lil snippet here Because this is everything new Right I just copy that on its cut that as well Go back to The JCP interface And pasted in there Ok so now we have our In the safe Method before modelling We have this little snippet that will be executed And the same goes with In a custom buttons Bartender Models we've got our classes that are being added Now we said If we open the item So that means after we've saved it We want to actually take the value in this banner By the display it in the page How they are many ways to do this Since we already have this value I shouldn't be that hard So JavaScript to the rescue I'm gonna use JavaScript to do this So we have hands our script to the view file Or add JavaScript to the view footer so that means we can decide where to add the drama script Do we want to add to JavaScript in a file that gets included in the header of the document Or do we want to add it to the bottom of the view as a snippet ok that is really we were To do it Because you wanna use PHP So We gonna actually do some PHP in this Area here Where us in this is file area we cannot do pH So to show you exactly where this is gonna come out he's gonna just add a comment here Add Java Script Here And I'm gonna show you how we gonna do PHP P HP Also Works And We gonna save that Now we actually can go out of here and go compile this component And install and then go look at it scored So here and our save class We have Upload image And that is all Good and right Now let's search for our function here And there is a function also in the same class been added Through JCB interface so it was not lost It's not exactly the same place we were originally Placed it but it is in the same class and it's what we want we want those Classes to be available to us here Ok so that part is still good Now you wanna go look at the view And see where that JavaScript going to be at it So will this close images here Then go back up and open the view Then wait what Where are we Paula You wanna go to the demo View look And edit So we are looking at that specific View And you see here Is The JavaScript Ok So it's added it 2 hours script Area And I actually am able to To do PHP Echo In the script area Which is what We are going to do We going to check with her that Banner Value is available to us on this page And then we are going to Use it to actually render the image Are in it Appropriate place How to know where the values are We go back to its view HTML dot PHP Area And we see that here it gets the item and it places it in the item Global Class value So we have the value item we can therefore check if banner is in the item So what I will do Just So that you can Sort of see what's happening as well can't copy that And then I'm gonna go back to the editor View Where we put our I'm gonna say I just Wa dump That specific value And safe And so we can see all of that so let's go to the interface Ok we ask I have to add the word Exit exit sexy the correct way of doing it J exit To this and go little up because we got a little fader here it's gonna hide this and just Let's just take that out for now So we can see What's going on And then later Refresh or page Ok so we got it all broken that's fine But here at the bottom Are still not showing Let's take it to the top So we've added it here above everything it should actually shown Refresh There we go that's what you wanna see So we see that it is publicly accessible there's the banner value so we can check whether there Is actually A value in this weather it's a string and a hazard value because we know we controlling and value Busy can actually manually Add that value there Needs to do it through the upload field So we can check whether that has a string And if it does We can just create a little Show the image Underneath it's appropriate placement Ok so that's how I get to see the value So if you are dealing with something similar You can Do these kind of poking into the result sets to exactly where is Wharton How does it look and how do I get to it in Yeah that way You're not dependent on the way sort of Not knowing what's going on So now we here back in JCB we going to say F We gonna say if It is Set And If It is a I'm using the helper class here we've got a function in the helper cross called check string To see whether it has a length And that it is a string Not an array or Boolean or something like that Now This is the way you can Sort of use the helper class to use the brackets brackets brackets Component and then bracket bracket bracket help the salon salon Are you got And If that is true We want to Obviously load the image Because then it exists Now we wanna see where we wanna add this image and it's actually underneath the the upload I'm just gonna have it show up like a normal image so we gonna just do some jQuery 322 To do that Ok so we are doing This image source and we are going there item better We know it's a string We can add a class here Now you can target this class And make it nice with CSS Just add your sis is here To view Just here you can add your CSS so here
