Hi Welcome My name is Llewellyn van der Merwe I'm the developer of component builder for Joomla I would also be Giving you the instructions of how to use it Just wanna look at a few issues Apparently was built Does you know PHP If you don't know PHP there are some Great places to Start Learning from 1 To those I would mention this Lynda.com And you do me You could go on to their websites and you can simply search for PHP And you would find Guns of courses And I suppose Do more than enough to to get you on your way If you don't know CSS JavaScript HTML then certainly you need to go visit this website And get that knowledge It was not developed for those who Have no but developing skills Because Simply I developed it actually for myself As developer of components Sorry I can easily and quickly get Most of the bulk of the And I could just be focused on the actual custom Code which Goes beyond the norm So that's what it's really made To do If you don't have an understanding of the Joomla API It's only gonna be 2 your own Disadvantage It's not that difficult to get it on the standing You need to just be able to read PHP And open Website go to library start reading with Glasses Even go to gym as own components That means You'd simply Go to H&M reinstall that's this one here And you go to components and you would go to Content manager Look at its folder structures Man open If you obviously if you know cmv And the controllers need some models there Views Open a view Start opening the script itself Read through it If using NetBeans You can hold onto a function like that one Press Ctrl shift I'll show you where In your Joomla website That function is the And You can You can open that file And you can Open source in editor Amigo And you can start By doing these kind of things You can start learning in the way that the code Connects to each other Through just looking at gym alone Components Basically that's how I got to know how things work I accept we went here Help her content Then opened Right in the next window Look through the Class Methods Glassware of variables Which ones did it's extending This one isn't extending any So That's how I got to know how most things work And That's also how most other developers I suppose are able to get their hands on this And so the better you know the July p i To the more advantage to yourself Because you will understand that this application is really implementing the API itself over Renova I didn't reinvent things I'm trying to stay as close to the conventions Possible And as I become aware of Better ways of implementation I would like to That again So even if you know a better way to doing it Please communicate with me I would likely Updated Glued and change Whatever is needed You must be willing to get your hands dirty now the one of the issues Disappear means that if you have built something and it doesn't work You need to debug it Which means Possibly you would like to run a local Sandbox environment I'm running here on a boom 2 It's my local sandbox And so I have BHP on it and Got MySQL installed Angie Miller So if I was to open a browser And I would type it Local This is my local install so you can see I just typed in BDM And I have Basically a few sites here Test one is the one we will be working in And The one in which component the holder is being developed Is this component builder 1 And No sights have happened so this is just my own little Script that I've dumped onto my own little server And I can now Change that Say Ok Let's go to Builder VDM That's another Site And it's loading some of the Test Displays that I'm working on And I add Administrator do that Open the back end And I can login So I'm running in a Sandbox environment And what does The advantages as you don't have any internet Involvement View that already do it know all these advantages but those of you don't You you can basically work offline mostly And And as well you can At Things like xdebug Another script Which help you debug Your application very easily We doing that in online developing sorry Off-site environment is Time consuming in Difficult Expensive So it's much easier doing it offline in the game if you don't know how to do that Please visit luno.com mint Look at a course called thank you Up and running with PHP Linux developer Linux server Running my neck Wait let me quickly go fine at hold up Ok you have it up and running with Linux for PHP developers by John pack Is an excellent course to get your own Local Developing environment setup I don't know this Your hours gonna be helpful But there it is AP Apache tutorials up and running Linux PHP developers Find I'm sure if you've watched this I've watched it Any Moons ago And it's been very helpful To get my Initials Sandbox setup Obviously since then And I suppose with yourself as well you'll find it you you get better And you find better ways But it's a good place to start Ok so that is about getting your hands dirty Component builder best place of Function of being function off is offline If you gonna do it online please realise that there might be security risks Especially when you've compiled An application It places it into your temporary folder which can be accessed From From anywhere Anyone can access your temporary folder on your Server Of your website So Yes you can delete the application from there in mediately with a button which are show you later But it is still I feel unsafe and the purpose of the application was Live in a developing environment where you have to Mill I installed and where you can really test it Densely So I would still suggest it None the less you do it that way Ok doll Finally we almost there Finish with the introduction since it's free please help me to ensure the future Picture of this component By not sharing it's training videos online All with anyone else this is really the only way that I can sustain this Development Easy View Don't share these videos so please if you be so kind If you have an organisation or you your a company and you have a Others that's gonna view it I suppose I can't stop you from doing that but I would encourage you there for then Do consider making a contribution when you are starting to reap the benefits of The time that this application saves you so that this application can be further developed for the rest of the The community and also for yourself We would like to also involve you on kid up so you can go to get up Sports lights video - IO That's Joomla component Basically this place here
