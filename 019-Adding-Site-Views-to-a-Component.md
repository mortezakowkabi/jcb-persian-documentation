# Adding Site Views to a Component in Joomla Component Builder (JCB)

Site Views in JCB define what users see on the front end of your Joomla component.

1. **Login to Joomla Administrator.**
   Open your Joomla backend and log in as an administrator.

2. **Navigate to Component Builder.**
   From the main menu, go to **Components → Component Builder → Components**.

3. **Select Your Component.**
   Open your existing component (for example, *Sermon Distributor*).

4. **Go to the Settings Tab.**
   Inside your component, locate the **Settings** tab.
   This is where both **Admin Views** and **Site Views** are managed.

* **Admin Views:** Used to manage backend data and configuration.
* **Custom Admin Views:** Allow adding custom pages in the admin area.
* **Site Views:** Define the structure and data presented on the front end of your Joomla site.

To add or manage Site Views:

* Go to the **Custom Admin Views** and **Site Views** sections.
* Click **"Add Custom Admin View"** if you need new ones (Sermon Distributor, for example, has none).
* Move on to **Site Views** to configure your public-facing component views.

You may notice that some Site View checkboxes or toggles appear **unselected** even though you selected and saved them earlier.

### Important

This is a **Joomla JavaScript glitch** - not an issue with JCB.

**How to handle it:**

1. If the Site View options look unselected after saving:

   * Close the Site View editor.
   * Reopen it again.
2. The selections should now appear correctly.
3. Avoid saving while the boxes are unchecked - this would save `null` values and cause unexpected results.

> **Tip:** The same issue can occasionally occur in Admin Views. Always double-check before saving.

## [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h02m21s) - Exploring Site View Options

Each Site View in JCB offers **four key switches**:

| Option           | Description                                                       | Typical Use                                                  |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Menu**         | Adds this Site View as a selectable menu item in Joomla.          | Allows users to link the view from Joomla's menu system.     |
| **Metadata**     | Enables metadata (title, description, keywords) for this page.    | For SEO and browser metadata display.                        |
| **Default View** | Sets this view as the fallback (default) page for your component. | Used when no specific view is requested or access is denied. |
| **Access**       | Enables access control (permissions and groups).                  | Restricts who can view specific pages or data.               |

Let's break down each option below.

### [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h02m46s) - Menu Option

When **Menu = Yes**, JCB automatically creates an XML definition so Joomla recognizes the Site View as a menu type.

**Effect:**
After compiling the component:

1. Go to **Menus → Add New Menu Item** in Joomla.
2. Under **Select Menu Item Type**, your component's view (e.g., "List of Sermons") will now appear.
3. Selecting it will link the front-end display directly to that Site View.

> **Tip:** This saves time - you don't have to manually write XML for Joomla menu types.

---

### [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h03m47s) - Metadata Option

When **Metadata = Yes**, JCB adds metadata-handling scripts to your generated view.

**To make this work properly:**

1. Ensure your model passes metadata fields into the view.

   * Typically found in the `$this->item` or `$this->items` arrays.
2. Compile your component.
3. Open the generated file:
   `/components/com_yourcomponent/views/viewname/view.html.php`
4. Check that metadata is loaded and assigned properly.

If the data isn't present, Joomla won't display metadata even if the switch is enabled.

> **Tip:** Always verify that the model returns metadata for your Site View items.

### [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h04m53s) - Default View Option

The **Default View** acts as the component's **home page** or fallback route.

**Guidelines:**

* You can **only have one default view** per component.
* When Joomla can't determine which view to load, it automatically redirects to this one.
* It's also used as the fallback when a user lacks permission to access other views.

Example:
If your default view is **Preachers**, and a user visits a restricted "Sermon" view, they will be redirected back to "Preachers" with a message.

> **Important:** Do not select multiple default views. Only one should be active.

---

### [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h05m37s) - Access Option

The **Access** switch enables permission control for each Site View.

**Purpose:**
Allows JCB to include the necessary access tables so that:

* Users only see views they have permission for.
* Joomla's Access Levels (Public, Registered, Special, etc.) are respected.

**Implementation Details:**

* Access can be handled at both **item** and **view** levels.
* Uses **user groups** and **access levels** to control who can view what.
* When this option is checked, JCB ensures the access fields and logic are built into your component.

> **Tip:** Always configure access levels in Joomla after installation to match your component's logic.

## [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_HJeYL8ps&t=00h06m32s) - Final Step: Compile and Test

Once you've configured your Site Views:

1. Click **Save & Close** in JCB.
2. Go to **Component Builder → Compile** and compile your component.
3. Install or update the generated component package in Joomla.
4. Open your Joomla front end and test:

   * The menu links.
   * Metadata presence.
   * Access restrictions.
   * Default view redirection.

> **Result:** Your Site Views are now active, accessible, and properly configured.

## Helpful Tips

* Always **reopen the Site View editor** before saving if selections appear off.
* Use **Menu = Yes** to expose the view to Joomla's menu manager.
* Only **one Default View** should ever be active.
* Use **Access Control** wisely to protect sensitive pages.
* After major changes, **recompile and reinstall** the component to apply updates.
