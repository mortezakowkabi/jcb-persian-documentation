Hi Now let's look at adding admin views and side views to component Builders component And looking at all the different switches and the nice features that we have there So first login here They may have component builder open on the component burger And then we will go to Finance And we will open Some industry Tributo And then go to settings And then settings you see there is a place for admin views we're ready illustrated adding the admin views Then there's custom admin views and there are side views I do wanna look at those now so I'll just click on add custom admin View There isn't any added to this component because Sorry 7 distributor does not have Customer reviews But I'll illustrate it in another component for you Land site views It has quite a few You might sometimes open it and see That some of the buttons are not selected Although you know you selected it previously and saved You know now doesn't show This is a glitch and In the July Zone JavaScript for whatever That is causing this and so the only way I have found to solve it as yet is to send Open Like for now you see the app and do the same So if you close it and open it again It has it all selected This is a heads up keep a look out for this because if you make changes and save it with those Your build will Not include those values Since it will be stored is now And Yeah you might get unexpected results So voice make sure that your old pics are Place that just a heads up Something I can change the state Laughing Repeatable fields Ok so if we go to side view And we just Closer again Open it again You see everything is selected You see that it has 123 Four options here Obviously here you select the side views Just add as many as you like Then add menu means that this side view will be added to the admin you Aspect of Joomla Erase you go to create menu And then you go to admin you Item Then there is a select Type and when you click on select type then there is this list Articles and whatever I do say yes there you'll create a XML file Which allows Similar to notice that your component needs to be in the list And the XML file will look at in the moment But that's just do know that's what this Switch here admin you does Add metadata means that Page Is gonna actually make use of the Net the metadata That is being passed to it Usually that means that in your model you've set up your data So that there is a Metadata in the items array or in the Yeah in the item array or in diverse array Either Bye-bye The global setting or Why are the actual item So this is meta implementation You even if you said yes yeah And you did not Set up the data in the in the model Correctly it won't work and the way for you to look at that is obviously clicky is here try it The best setting up the data the model then compile and go look in the view Data SIM Albert php file to see how it grabs the metadata because it will still add The Script that is needed to load the metadata into the You the document But if it doesn't Grab it correctly Then you'd see that as well Ok then Whether you can only have one default View So don't like more than one too yes What to do if your view effectively is is that sometimes when You make a change and the system doesn't know where you wanna go It actually throws you back to the default View Now that before view could I maybe your sites default view being home page Or it can be if your in this component it could be for example on this one it's preachers So Let's say some of these views you you said that they don't let us use her Public user don't have access for example 2 sermon then if they try to access that The system will throw them back to the default view and give him a message saying you don't have access Answer that's what the default View Primarily used for at the moment But I can see it being coming even more useful as we continue to improve in component Builder Then add access It's basically making sure that a Sydney user has the specific access rights You see in a in an item you can set the access rights As well as the view rights So it's multiple implementations Different department Asians one has access groups the other one is just groups And so you can tweak whether you want access on this specific View to be monitored And If you take that N Component building will ensure that the access Table is there Ok So that is adding a side view 2 Do your component Obviously after having created the side view Then this is how you can add it to check it See how it works Ok now next up we gonna look at Custom admin views being added Thank you for watching
