The directories, folders and files of the JCB Demo component, found in the JCB component installation package and installed with JCB is presented here for your convenience. For simplicity, it is recommended you install only Joomla! and the compiled JCB Demo component without installing JCB to follow along since that is what this directory structure was derived from. There are many other directories and files installed as part of Joomla! and at this stage we wish to focus on the Demo component and not the Joomla! core and API used extensively by JCB to build the Demo component.

To accomplish this, a local installation of Joomla! and only the Demo component is suggested to follow along as you go through the directory tree using whatever file manager your Operating System has to go through the directory tree, locate and open the files in each one shown below and peruse it contents. This will introduce you to a typical MVC directory structure for a component that is not complex, but most of which is common to all components, regardless of their complexity. Keep in mind as you progress through the videos and accompanying chapters in this manual that variations will occur and this structure will become more complex with many additional files. However, they all share one thing in common which is the MVC paradigm and follow its basic structure. Beneath the directory structure presented next you will find a short explanation of their relation to the component itself, and also the areas of the JCB component that builds each.
