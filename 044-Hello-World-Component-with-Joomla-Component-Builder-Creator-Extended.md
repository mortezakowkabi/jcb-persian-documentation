### Application Of Extention

[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m00s)(_Click on these time links to see Youtube video_)

This is a tutorial on how to build a Hello World Component with Joomla Component Builder. Joomla Component Builder is a Joomla Component which helps you to develop Joomla Components quite easily. I originally developed this application or extension for myself that I can maintain the code in a very consistent and shareable way. 

* ### Changes in one place - Compiled in all Components

[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s)

For example: Since there are a lot of concepts in components that are built for Joomla, which may be called Conventions or Boilerplate Implementation. These things are always the same. I wanted something like a wireframe that could just take care of that for me all the time.If we were to have manually written this without any boilerplate tool or wire script that could help us write all the classes and tables and stuff and it took us 25 hours.[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m09s) Even if Joomla was to change, to be able to make a change in one place, and then compile it into all the components that I have developed. Then have them run stable again on Joomla, instead of having to go to every one of those components. We have gone beyond developing the most basic parts of a Component and ventured into some of its complexities.[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m40s) That is why showing a Hello World Component being built by Joomla Component Builder. It is going to end up being quite an advanced Component. 

### Become A Community Project

[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m57s)

I had build JCB for myself, and it was not intended as a community project. It has since become a community project with the code open on GitHub. [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m19s) With only functionality in mind, I did not contemplate the complexity thereof during the development and set conventions in place which I know how to use. [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m43s)  On the surface JCB might look just like any other Component Builder, but when you start to use it and come to know some of its secrets, it is amazing how conventions, even conventions that you would use when you develop components yourself would make JCB do things that are quite amazing. 

[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m16s)
So you will end up to realize that JCB has a lot of functions. Most of the basic ones have been explained in the tutorials that can be found on YouTube which can be accessed from this link 'Access Tutorials'.

### Need To Know - PHP - Joomla API

[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s)

If you do not know PHP and Joomla's API you should not expect to build complex components with JCB.    [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m44s) If you do, the correct doors will open and the correct relationships can be set up to have those conventions dynamically built for you by JCB. If you are very good at PHP programming and know the Joomla API, you can simply go into the Compiler, and start reading the code. The Compilers code files are alphabetically ordered.  [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m20s) The first one is 'a_get.php' and so forth. Reading this code and understanding how JCB's Compiler Constructs the code would send you on a treasure hunt where you would discover amazing features.

### Necessary to Start with the Basics

[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m50s)

It is necessary to start with the basics. That is to build a Hello World Tutorial, in order to be able to combine the different concepts that are required for a component for it to be fully functional, and portable, and useful. 

 **Patience and Perseverance**

[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m23s)

There are two principals to mention before we start. One is patience, the other is perseverance. Within any programming career, these aspects are invaluable. [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m49s) This is what has made JCB possible and this is also what would make you successful in using JCB.[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m17s)  It is not a component which is claimed to have no internal conflicts or inconsistencies but it is most certainly a component with which I have developed countless mini-program components which I am maintaining. 

### Basic Steps To Understand How To Build
            * Need Joomla Website
            * Offline or on a Server
           

[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m01s)

The basic steps. You would need a Joomla website. This Joomla website would preferably be on a developing environment, which is either offline or on a server which is not necessarily used in production. [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m30s) Not because JCB itself is unsafe. It is simply just more convenient. If it is offline, the code can be opened in your IDE. JCB has the feature to extract this customized code out of your component and put it back on compilation, a feature that does exist but which will not be discussed during this tutorial. 

### Local Environment Is Ideal

[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s) 

A local developing environment is most ideal for this.  By using certain protocol, a tunnel may be set up between your desktop and live server and still have this kind of interaction of editing code live and then compiling and seeing changes. That may be done if you are able to manage any kind of complexity; [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m27s)  It is suggested that if JCB is installed, and there are some limitations in a shared hosting environment, to first resolve that or move development offline. 

### Ways To Install JCB - Download Package - URL From GitHub - Install From The Web

[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m56s)

First, go to the Joomla Website and log in. Then install JCB. Simply go to 'Manage' and 'Install'. There are different ways to install JCB. A package may be downloaded, or a URL may be grabbed from GitHub, or it can also be installed from the web.[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m20s) It is listed with Joomla. If JCB is searched, it brings up JCB on the page but it would not necessarily always do that. 

### JCB One Of The Listed Developing Tools

[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m35s)

If you do not find a Component in the search, this 'Component Builder' is the Component. Then you could go down to an area called 'Tools', and then 'Developing Tools'. [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m06s) JCB is one of the listed Developing Tools. Here it is only listed as a Component Builder. You can click on that, and simply click install. This 'Install' will then grab a URL from GitHub. [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m33s) The Joomla Installer may also be used, and simply click install. How fast it will take will depend on your own network. This is quite a big file, and in certain areas, it might be a limitation if used outside of a local developing environment. 

### Need To Understand and Setup Components: Field Types, Fields, Views

[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m57s) 

Now that JCB is installed there are some things that need to be understood concerning the way most Joomla Components are constructed. We are going to build a Component called 'Hello World'. The way to set up a component is to first understand Field Types. [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m31s) Then the Fields need to be set up and then the Views that are needed in your Component. 

### Views Mapped Back to Database - Admin Views

[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m40s)

These Views also map back to the database. These are what is called Admin Views. Admin Views have Fields and Fields are the Database Columns. Admin Views are the Database Tables, [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m59s) Fields are the Database Columns and these are the Field Types(Please see video). There is a Text Field, Radio, List, Multiple Selection, Checkbox, a Date Field. There are many types of Fields. Each Field independently is linked to a type, but there are some Database Settings within each Field as it gets linked into the Admin View since the Fields form the Columns of the Tables of the Admin Views. This is how a Component is set up.

### First Build the Back End then Add in the Front End

[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m34s)

Once a component has been set up, then you are done with what we would call the back end. [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m49s) With JCB the back end of the component should be built first, and then only add in the front end. 

### Front End has not its own Database

[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m58s)

The front end does not have its own Database. It pulls its data from the back end Database. Having explained some of that, let's show this in action. 

### JCB can be Extended

[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m15s) 

In JCB it ships with quite a lot of Fieldtypes. Open the Fieldtypes area. There are many Fieldtypes already setup. JCB is built in a way that it can be extended. Like SubForm is a new Fieldtype which was recently introduced into Joomla Community. It also replaces an old Fieldtype called Repeatable Fields. 

### Joomla Discontinuing Repeatable Fields - Migrate Repeatable Fields to SubForm Fields

[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m40s)

It is advisable not to use Repeatable Fields anymore. Since JCB used Repeatable Fields quite excessively, [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m49s) and due to the fact that Joomla is now discontinuing this Fieldtype, we had to migrate all of the Repeatable Fields to SubForm Fields. Part of the reason why I am redoing the Hello World tutorial is because of the fact that Sub Forms are now being used all across JCB and there have been a few changes in implementation. 

### Add New Fieldtypes

[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m23s)

Here you can see all the Fieldtypes that I have set up in JCB already. You could always add new Fieldtypes as JCB and Joomla continues to evolve. Whenever you would be confronted by a Fieldtype that needs a bit of extra tweaking within the Compiler, I would hope to be ahead of you in adding that Fieldtype if necessary. [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m54s) With most of the time Fieldtypes extra help is not needed. It is only Fieldtypes like Subform and perhaps with some Fieldtypes like URL, Text, Tel, SQL, and Tag that help may be necessary  

### Fieldtypes Helps Setup Properties

[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m14s)

The way a Fieldtype work is that it helps you set up what is known as the Properties. The property has a Name, it has a Default value, it is either Adjustable or not Adjustable. It is Mandatory or not Mandatory and Translatable. It can be given a Description, that when the Fieldtype is used you can always come back to this. This information can be gathered from going through the Joomla Core Libraries. [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m49s) Because Fieldtypes are only mapping Joomla's own implementation of Fieldtypes. If a Fieldtype is opened that has already been created like the Text field, it may be seen that these properties are already there and in place. The Fieldtype is 'text'. The 'name' is 'any text'. When we say that the type is 'text', then this is not adjustable, but if it is adjustable, it can be ticked. [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m18s) It is most certainly Mandatory.  Most of the Fieldtypes had been created already and are ready to be used.

### Creating Fieldstypes

[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m42s)

Most of the time you can simply start with Fields. There are already quite a few Fields, but I am going to continue as if it does not exist, and create two or three Fields that can be used in our Hello World Component.[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m52s) To create the first Field: Click on 'New', then select 'Text' as the Fieldtype.  All the Field Information is brought in by Ajax from the Fieldtype. 

### Quick Demonstration On Adding A Fieldtype

[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m24s)

To give a quick demonstration: If I click on this button(pencil), and say; change this(ValueExample) to text'tt' and save and close and return to Fields and click 'New', then select 'Text field' again.[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m53s)  Three t's has been added in there. Since this whole structure has been built from the Fieldtypes Default Settings, which we just looked at. I am going to change that back quickly, and for example, put something in the Description. [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m22s) I am going to take text again, and you will see those oooo's are showing up here. This means that this whole area is dynamically populated from the values that are put up in the Fieldtype and so does this XML(field definition) structure usually populates the demo or default values that you have added when you created the Fieldtype.[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m57s)  JCB ships with most Fieldtypes already in place, it appears like this is something we have done, but it is something that you can extend and even change. For example: If you know that the Text Fieldtype has more properties than we have set up, you can add more to it and simply click on this 'edit' or before creating a Field, you can go to the Field types, and open the Text Fieldtype and click on the green button and add more Properties.[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m34s)  Those Properties will dynamically also appear within the area where the Fields are created. [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m57s) Things in JCB has not been set hard into code but is movable, easy to scale and easy to customize.
### Creating A Field

[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m18s) 

The first field that we are going to create is a Text field, which we will call 'Greetings'. Then Update the label with 'greetings' in the 'XML Field definition' area. This is what will be visible in the Database, 'greeting' (singular) is going to be the Database Name. Most of the others will be left as default. [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m48s)  Let's just maybe change the hint 'add greetings here'. Then remove the description. Take out the default text, otherwise, it will always appear. 

### Databases

[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m19s)

Now in regards to the Database, that is what these features are all about. Since Text Fields can differ, not all of them are going to be this size. It is up to you to decide what kind of Text Field this is going to be. A bit more knowledge about MySQL and Databases is necessary to effectively use this. [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m49s) If you do not know what would be the best for a Text Field or a Date Field, Google that or simply look at Joomla's own implementation. It has an article Manager, and you can go into its XML Database and look at what Database Values was used and just use the same whatever be the case. [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m14s) Because these values are all movable, and by setting them wrong, could break things. Having created our first field, we can reuse Name and maybe also Description. [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m23s) Those are part of the Demo Component. Since Fields can be linked into any Admin View and therefore belong to any Component, it does not matter if it is already linked to the Demo Component. Although, if it is changed, it will affect both Components.

### Creating an Admin View - Preparations - Object Orientated Development

[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m46s)

Having created our Fieldtypes and also a Field, let's create an Admin View. Admin Views is the back end of the Component. There is a whole lot of tutorials around the web about **Object Orientated Development** to give some perspective into the; How should it work? What should be where? What should have its own classes? What should have its own tables? Where are we going to put what? All this preparation should be done before coming to JCB. Once you have all that planned, only then it is possible to create Fields, create Admin Views, which is your Tables which can be linked to a Component. Once that has been done, the foundation is laid of your application. [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m53s) Now you can start to work on that which will make the front end unique. 

### Creating Admin Views

[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m02s)

First Admin View. The System Name is to identify the View. If there be more than one View with the name greetings. For example: If you have built quite a few components that deal with Hello World, and have three or four different variations of greetings and say this is the first one. (See video) [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m21s)  By doing that it is identifiable within the drop-down list across your application of JCB. It will be seen when the greeting is later selected, that the System Name is used in the drop-down list. 

### Name (single record), Name (list of records)

[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m48s)

There will be a 'Name(single record)' and a 'Name(list records)'. Single record is also the Edit View. That is when you are looking at one record, and are editing that record in the Admin area, that is the single record. That is also what will be used when you tweak JCB to add an Edit option to the Site area of your Website.  [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m22s) Since JCB can do that on the fly, this single record would also affect the front end of your component in that case which will be demonstrated later on. I am going to call the single record 'Greeting' and the list record 'Greetings'.  

### Type: Read And Write

[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m42s)

Obviously, we want to have the ability to read and write on the Type table. If this is a 'read' only, it means that the data is in this Admin area can not be changed via Joomla. Unless you have added some JavaScript and some other nice conventions around your component that sort of creates data for that area dynamically as people use the component. This turns all the fields in the area as read-only, and if an attempt is made to change them, they never get submitted to the Database. Leave it always by Default as read and write. 

### Short Description

[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m38s)

Give it a short description. Go to Fields and Conditions. This will be displayed: 'button to create admin field conditions will show once the Admin View is saved for the first time.'  So Fields cannot be added to this Admin View if it has not been saved. That is one of the changes that came as a result of moving away from Repeatable Fields to Subform Fields. The Admin View is a Table on its own and its relationship with the Fields is also a Table on its own. At this stage, you should not click save and close first but just save once, so that it creates this Admin View in the Database. 

### Fields And Conditions

[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m28s)

Go to Fields and Conditions. There you will be able to link, Linked Fields and create Field Conditions. We are not going to create Conditions since this is a demonstration of a very basic component. 

### Linked Fields

[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m45s) 

We're just going to create a Linked Fields. Linked Fields are the Fields that we created previously. Click on create. It is going to ask if we are sure that all our work has been saved in the Admin View. If it not and OK is clicked, it will be lost. [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m06s) It will open an area where you can link Fields to your Admin View. This looks very similar to the pop-up in Repeatable Fields, except that it is its own View now. If the green button is clicked, it opens an area where you select the Fields that need to be used.

 * ### Example Name(Text) Field

[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m30s)

There is the Name Field and that is a text field. We want it to show in the Admin List View and to show first in the Order in List views. I should behave as a Title and must be Sortable, Searchable not Filterable, because then every name would be a filter, but definitely Linkable. This means if someone clicks on the Name, it will open the Greeting, and can then be edited. There are only two Tabs at this stage.  [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m07s) If you want to know more about the Tabs, please go through the tutorials and look up Tabs to see more on this subject. I am going to let it be Left in the Tab and in the Tab(Order in Edit) and let it be the first item. No Permissions will be added to this, but there is an Editing Permission available at this stage. [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m33s) That would create Permissions around this Field, which can be tweaked, as to who can edit it, and who can not. This can also be controlled from a Global view perspective or on a field level. These are some of the hidden advantages the JCB has in handling permissions across your component quite easily. 

* ### Example Greetings Field

[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m57s)

The Next Field that is added, is Greetings. We want the Greetings to be in the Admin List View and want it to be second in the Order in List views, also to be Sortable and Searchable. It does not need to be a Link and should be on the Right in the Tab and to be first in Order in Edit. That is all that is necessary. Click 'Save and close'. This will link those Fields to this Admin View. If Fields and Conditions are opened again, those Fields will be seen with all the variations that we have selected; ready to use. [00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m33s)  With the Admin View that has been set up, our component can be created. Click save and close or just close. No changes had been made in this view since we have returned, this area is already been saved. [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m59s) Click 'close', but clicking 'save and close', is always the safest choice. 

### Creating The Component

[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m11s)

Now that the Admin View is in place, the Component can be created. Click 'new'. We are going to give our Component a System Name since this is the second Hello World tutorial, called version 2. It is given a Code Name which is the same as the first one; Hello World, and its Version '2.0.0' [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m35s) It will be necessary to add Company Names, Author, Email, Website, and Short Description. 

### Adding A Admin View

[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h34m01s)

Now with those things in place, the next thing to do would be to add an Admin View. Since the Admin View can only be added once the component has been saved for the first time. 'Save' it. The component has been saved. Open the Admin View, it can be linked to this Component. Under Settings, there are two places where this may be done. Click on Component Admin View, and click on this 'Create component admin view for this Joomla component'. [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h34m40s) Or in the Admin Views click: 'Create'. Both these buttons lead to the same place. This used to be the old way to add Admin Views to Components and that is why it has been left there. But within the new JCB after the transition away from Repeatable Fields, it can all be handled within the Admin View Tab. Just click Create. If we are sure all our work is saved; Click 'OK'. Again there is something that looks very similar to that when we were linking the Fields, except that we are dealing with the Admin View and linking Admin Views to this Component. 

### Clicking On Plus Button To Open First Line

[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h35m25s)

Click on the Plus Button to open the first line. We need to link the Greeting in View. Leave the Default Icon of Joomla, there is a whole list of Icons available. These icons are Icomoons which are the Joomla Default Icons that are part of the Joomla back end and front end. Search 'Icomoon' and you will find on Joomla's website a whole picture map of all these icons. [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m04s) Then I most certainly want this view to be part of the Main Menu and would like an 'add record' on the Dashboard. If I want a 'list record' on the Dashboard, that means clicking on something and it shows us the list of greetings; I want it in the Submenu. 

### Auto Check-in Feature

[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m23s)

The Auto Check-in feature. When a record is created that is stored in the Database and someone else comes and wants to edit that record, and want to prevent people from working on the same record at the same time since one of them is going to lose their work. Joomla has this feature by which you can check out an item, and when someone else tries to open it, it tells them that it is not available, it has been checked out. [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m58s) Apparently this check-out may be problematic because if people do not save, and open it may be to have a look at it, and then instead of clicking cancel or close, they just click back. The item does not get checked back into the database.[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h37m19s) The Auto Check-in feature is a nice add-on that JCB has set in place, which you can set that an item which is checked out longer than a day, is obviously one that was missed, and should be checked-in automatically. This is one of the reasons why I developed JCB because I have all these little tweaks that I want in all my views but I know that [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h37m46s) if Joomla changes something and I need to change this little tweak, and have to go to every single view will be  cumbersome. Simply click whether you would like this and if Joomla makes a change that we need to know and adapt this feature we just change it in the Compiler and it immediately compiles correctly all the components mapped in it. 

### Keeping Of History - Feature

[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m10s)

The other great feature is this 'Keeping of History' to keep track of all the changes made to any item of Greeting. Simply tick this 'Keep History' and JCB will dynamically add all the needed structures and Joomla's [00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m30s) Integrated History Component will work alongside your third-party Component and keep track of every item and its changes. That is just a tick box and JCB does the work. 

### Has Metadata Adds Metadata Fields To The View

[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m43s)

The 'Has Metadata' adds the metadata Fields to the view. You do not need to add them, it gets added just by ticking the box in the 'Has Metadata' column. 

### Add Access

[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m55s)

This View has an Access function, here all these Access levels can be set which are Public, Special or Registered. Do you want to implement these levels of access to this view? Usually, this is used if you want the view to be editable on the front end of the Site because then you will use the Access to control some of these. More of that as we continue. If you need an Import/Export function, tick it accordingly and likewise do if we want to add an Edit/Create Site View for this Admin View.  [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h39m38s) If we want it to be first, then set it in the 'Order' column. This Admin View has all the features that an Admin View can have by Default in JCB. The code that JCB is going to write to do this implementation, is quite stable, and yet dynamic, that as Joomla evolves and changes, we can tweak these codes in the Compiler and make sure that it remains stable this way. [00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h40m15s) Save and close. Now that this Admin View has been linked to the Component, we can go to Admin Views and see this Admin View as well the Icon. Click on this pencil and it will take you to the Admin View. Make sure that all your work has been saved in this area, click OK, if it is, and it opens the Admin View where we linked the Fields. [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h40m48s) and You can work in the Admin View from the Component.  

### Adding Permissions

[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h41m03s)

I am adding some Permissions to demonstrate the Permission Structure regarding the front end Management of Editing these items. I am going to use the Core. There is the option of using what is known as the 'view.edit' [00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h41m22s) instead of 'core.edit' then it means its relationship is just for this view. If I want it to be related to the Core which means that it is not going to be only related to this view, but whatever I change in the Core will affect this view. For more explanation on the permissions, there is this tutorial which is available in the Description. Watch this tutorial and also maybe do some changes. Compile the Component and look at the code. [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h41m54s) The code really tells you what has been done. There are many ways to learn how JCB does things when you make changes and then to compile the component and to look at what has changed. Usually using something like Git will be very useful in discovering the changes. There is also a way for you to know where in the Compiler's specific code is being created which I will show you as we continue. 

Since changes were made, save and close it. [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h42m36s) This will take us back to the Component where everything is still the way we left it. [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h43m04s) In the demonstration of a Hello World Component we have done quite enough regarding the back end. All that now remains is to compile.  Click Save and Close, go to the Compiler and select the Component and Compile. That means that 9000 lines of code have just been written, 51 folders and 122 files were created.[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h43m36s) If we had to manually write all the classes and tables and stuff without the help of any boilerplate tool or wire script, it will take us 25 hours to do it. Just here JCB has saved you a lot of time.

### Installing The Component

[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h44m17s)

Now the Component can be installed by clicking this 'install com_hello_world_v2_0_0_J3_on this Joomla Website' button or grabbing the URL and going to the normal installer. Because it has Compiled a ship-able Joomla Component Package which can be installed on any Joomla Website. 

### Select An Image

[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h44m42s)

There is no image showing because a Component image has not been selected. (See video). Go back, and clear the temporary folder. [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h45m01s) For example, the Demo Components Image is selected as our Hello World Component. In the Component, there is an area to select an Image. Save and close again. Go back to the Compiler and compile it again and click 'Install'. Now there is a new Component in this Joomla Website. Open in a new tab. [00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h45m45s) The Component has now been installed. It has a Greetings Tab and an Add Greetings Tab. There are no images selected for it. Going back to the Admin Views and then to Greetings and first click on Greetings as an Admin View. There is a place for Icons and the Add Icon. [00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h46m13s) Select the bucket as the 'Icon' for 'Greetings' and another bucket with a little green plus is added for 'Add a Greeting'. Click Save and Close.

'Greetings' is set up and I am going to compile it again. [00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h46m39s) Usually, when a change has been made, it should be compiled in the Compiler and then installed and it should then show in the Component. When it gets a little bit more advanced, we do not only look at the Component in Joomla [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m03s) but also look at the code. The two icons are in place. If I click Add Greeting, we see the Name and Greetings. There are also all these other fields added by default. So the created and the Metadata and the Permissions are all in place. That is how you would set up a basic Hello World Component.

 ### Hello World Configuration

[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m34s)

There is a Check-in timer in Options and it can be changed to 5 hours, the one that checks in the items. The history version is enabled and set to remember 10 versions of any item created as a greeting.[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m57s) The Permission structure is in place which includes the Greeting, Access, Greetings Batch Use, Dashboard Add and so forth which are all the switches related to the greetings area. 

### From the Front End to The Component - How To View, Edit, Add Greetings

[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h48m16s)

Now if the Admin area is done, continue to the front end where I will illustrate how to view greetings that were created on the front end, how to edit greetings that were created and how to add more greetings from the front end to this component. Close the components edit area. 

### Two Dynamic Gets Created - Return A List Of Greetings 

[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h48m42s)

First, a Dynamic Get should be created. There are two ways to get to the Dynamic Get area. One is to click on 'Add Dynamic Get' and the other way would be via the submenu and then click New.  Two Dynamic Gets are needed; one to return a list of greetings and one to return a single greeting. The one Dynamic Get is going to return all the greetings that are available and published. The second one is when one of those greetings is clicked it should open only that greeting. The 'Name' is going to be used as who is being greeted, and then the greeting will only show when we click on the name and then show that individuals' greeting.

### Adding Edit/create Buttons Controlled By Permissions Structure Of JCB

[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h50m05s)

In this area is the full greeting. An Edit button is going to be added and a Create button is going to be added in the List area. These Create and Edit buttons are going to be controlled by the Permissions structure which JCB puts into your Component if it is set to do so. Setting up a Dynamic Get is quite easy. 

### First - Use Back-end View

 [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h50m23s)

First, use a Back-end View which is related to the component. Select that Back-end View, It shows Greetings(first). The system name is what is used in the dropdowns. Select Greetings(first). This one(getType) is going to bring back a 'getlistQuery'. We do not want any Pagination.(See video) We do not need the 'asset id'. [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h50m59s) Leave the 'created by' and the 'created', take out the 'modified', the 'version' may be left. The 'hits' and the 'ordering' are fine. The greeting is most certainly not needed in a list, only the name is needed. Give it a 'Name' as identification when the Site View is set up. Call this List Greetings and in brackets (Name only) so that weArea will know this is what it is. Although it can be saved it is not necessary to do it. 

### Tweaking The Data Without Saving

[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h51m47s)

You can just go right into tweaking the data without saving. The data tweak gives a little bit of control on the writing that JCB will do regarding this query. For example, if it should be ordered. The ordering is called 'a.ordering'. We want to order it ascending by the order set in the database. 

### Filter To Add

[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h52m22s)

Another filter is added to make sure that it only returns 'a.published' items. In the 'Where' area we placed 'a.published' and select 'Equal' in 'Comparison Operators', and '1' in 'Value Key', so only published values will be returned. There are some other features around the tweak area which I suppose goes beyond just in the normal Hello World Component, but there are tutorials about this on YouTube in that playlist that I've already referred to quite a few times. 

### Joint Area

[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h52m59s)

Then there is a 'Joint' area which we are not going to use, but it is a very nice way of linking to other related component tables. There needs to be a relationship between the Main table and the Joint table.  In the Main table click; Save & New. So another one can be done. 

### Creating Dynamic Get

[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h53m36s)

The next one is going to be 'Greeting'. We would like it to be one item.  Do a Back-end View. Again from the Greetings(list). This time we want the name and a greeting. We can still use the 'Published'. We do not need  'Modify by', 'Version' or 'Ordering'. We could have left out the 'Hits' in the previous setup. A little tweak should be done to make sure that it does not allow someone to grab an unpublished value by just adding an ID in the URL or something. Custom Script is OK. [00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h54m26s) We need to add a filter. The ID is going to be used. Passing the ID via the URL. So the State Key will be ID and it is going to be 'a.id' in Table Key, equals in 'Comparisons Operator'. It is this Filter Type that makes the item load. There are many ways to load items. Although it is a bit complex, it gives you the freedom and ability to build quite amazing things.
Please go and watch the tutorial on Dynamic Get on GitHub. 

### Two Dynamic Gets Created - Second Return One Greeting

[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h55m52s)

In the Dynamic Get all the values are selected that we want and can limit it. The tweak is in place and the limiting factors. It is not necessary to join it to any other tables, these values simply need to be returned.[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h56m09s) We could have added the username values if we wanted to. We want it to show who created this and say 'Created by', go to 'Joint', click on the 'Joint Database Tables' not 'Joint View Tables' because we want to use the 'User table' and want a single item returned and on 'Field' it will be 'a.created_by' and in the 'Joint Field' it will be 'b.id'. The 'Username' is needed but not the ID, it is already there, so only the 'user_name' is necessary. [00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h57m19s)  Use 'greeted_by', it is the one sending the greeting. Save and close. Now there is two 'Dynamic Gets', a 'Listgreeting', and a 'greeting'. This is what you need to build first. Look in the Database to get the necessary data for the page. [00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h57m54s) What would you want the people to see on the page? By that determine what data you are going to use from the Database and give identifiable system names because the next thing to do is to create a Site View. 

### Create A Site View

[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h58m12s)

There are Layouts and Templates that all can work together with Site Views. (Look at tutorials on YouTube).

### Site View - Greetings
* ### System Name

[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h58m30s)

I am going to build two Site Views. The first Site View is called the 'System Name Greetings'. Give it a Name called 'Greetings' and a Code Name 'greetings'.

* ### Name In Code

[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h58m55s)

The 'Code Name' is significant because it should not clash with 'Admin Views' that you have already created that are going to be 'Edit views' on the front since the listview is not being placed on the front of the component only the 'Edit View'. That means Edit Views' name is 'greeting'. A Code Name can not be set for the front called 'greeting' otherwise they will conflict. I am just going to use 'greeting' and for the single, 'greet'.  

* ### Description, Snippet

[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h59m41s)

A short Description is placed in; 'Greetings', as well as a short heading and adding it like that, will mean that this short string(list of Greetings) will get added to your language file. That is how language strings are created. By adding the snippet(Add Language String) anywhere in JCB will create a language string. 

* ### Main Get/Act Upon Compilation -  Dynamic Get/Look

[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h00m28s)

At the Main Get, you can select the 'Listgreetings'(name only). The distinct functions of the Main Get and a Dynamic Get are that you will act upon the one in the compilation and the other one is only to view. So if you end up here(Looking) and click save, it will not play any role whatsoever in the compilation. It will play a role when a JCB Package is exported but that is a different subject which will not be dealt with here. Good practice would be that these two, Main Get and Dynamic Get would be the same. Since you can add Custom Gets, but there are not any Custom Gets set up right now, so none can be selected, but you can add more than just your normal Main Get to a Site View.[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h01m17s) You can add the Main Get and then a bunch of Custom Gets which brings a large amount of data to the page from different variations of relationships.

* ### Listgreetings / Give Snippets

[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h01m42s) 

We want the 'Listgreetings' and so this 'Listgreetings' gives us a few Snippets. Do know that the Snippets are not always accurate because it is very difficult to always know exactly how the implementation is going to work out. I am giving you a snippet as to how I expect you would use the data. You can adjust that and this is where your knowledge of PHP will come into play. [01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h02m10s)  You should know what this and those little arrow items is there because we are working with an object. You must know what it means, how to use an object, how to interact with an object, how to parse over it, how to grab its values and how to update its values. All this is part of your background that you need to bring to JCB. JCB is not going to crank out customized Site Views the way it does the Admin Views. My idea was when it comes to Site Views I always want to do something different and I just want to have the ease of getting all the data on the page and then be creative. I have not spent much time to make this as automatic, I want to set up the back end and the Admin Views because this is what makes your component different from every other Component out there. [01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h03m15s) We want to encourage you to do you do a lot of preparation and thinking about Data Structures and relationships because your Dynamic Get can grab from so many data places and bring all that data to you in a nice object which you can then parse and display with a lot of permission switches as I will show you in a moment. That is giving you a little backdrop on the Dynamic Get and the Site View even the Custom Admin View, and its relationship and why it is like that.

* ### Looping Through Items

[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h03m58s)

By looping through those items, these two strings that have been found is all we need.<<<<<<<




A List View may be selected. _ We are busy working on adding the Bootstrap Library to JCB. At the moment we got UIkit version 2 linked to JCB and I have selected the List option for this Uikit. Uikit is a library developed by YOOtheme. Bootstrap has been decided on and so we are migrating to Bootstrap._  We are going to loop over the items. Show the name. Nothing is yet clickable, nothing is editable. It is to get you introduced to using Site Views. Save and close. 

### Back To Component Add Site View

[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h05m18s)

Now we going to go back to our Component and we are going to add the Site View to it. You might ask why don't we just add the Component to the Site View when we create the Site View? That was an idea that I did play with. But because of Database relationships and all kinds of reasons I felt that the better approach would be to link Site Views at the Component area instead of at the Site area. This gives us the option to use Site Views quite easily within other Components. That was the idea behind it We might rethink this and we might reshuffle this in the future. I mean this is the first time I build such a Component called JCB. Who knows what happens if we start refactoring it in a more Advancement program is get involved. It might become even far better than it is now. [01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h06m20s) This is how it works at the moment. 

### Creating A Site View

[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h06m23s) 

So you go to Site Views and click Create Linked Site Views. Then you select that Greeting Site View. You say yes I want to be able to Add Menu to the front of my website with this view. I want this view to use Has Metadata. It is going to be this Component Default View. I wanted to control Access. We will look at that again, but I want that Access that its default is Public. This is again making use of all the options and save and close. 

### Compiling The Component*

[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h07m09s)

If we go back to compiling our Component no changes are being done to the Database. 

* ### Heads Up - When Updating Your Component It Automatically Updates The Database

I need to give you a heads up here. If you're adding new tables, JCB is build to know that and add the tables to a Sequel Update. Which when you update the Component, it automatically updates the Database. But it's still important for you to check that it does this. For there could be a reason that it thinks that it's not necessary. Yet I tried to build enough places, things in place so that it will pick up that you've added [01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h08m05s) either a field or a new view to the Component and that the Component now needs to increment a version and release a table update. But sometimes that is not happening and then if you update your Component, the Database is not being updated necessarily. So that's just something you need to keep your finger on, make sure that it happens. For the most part, JCB will take care of that. Since this upgrade, we have only added a front end. We haven't touched the Database, everything about that, it is just the way it was before. 

### Compiling The Component(continue)*

[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h08m41s)

We can without any concerns just Compile and re-install the Component. And then go and add it to the front. We can look at what has happened. 

### Heads Up - Default Gets Set The First Time Component Gets Installed

Just a heads up. When you add a front end Site View and you set that to default that it should be public. If it's not the first time you installed the Component then that default cannot be set to the Database. Because it's a default that only gets set the first time the Component gets installed. I don't want to go into all the technical reasons for that but you could go into the Components Script File and you can search through it [01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h09m30s) to see what I mean. It's a function that gets added to the Script File and only gets implemented with on the first installation of the Component. That's important. If you do not follow what I was saying and why I said it, then I hope you'll understand it as I try and demonstrate these things. 

### Adding The Greetings To A Site View

[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h09m53s)

Before you can add the Greetings to a Site Menu. We've got at least four Greetings in place. We can add that list view to an Front and Site view. We go to Menus and go to Main Menu. Select the menu type. Click Hello World Greetings that was the previous Component. We've got Greeting set as the HOME of this website. We going to click save and close. [01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h10m54s) There we go. We've got HOME and Hello World Greetings. That should mean that if we click on this preview(demonstration button) the front end of the Site, we should see the Greetings. It's going to say 'The page isn't redirecting properly'. 

### Set Front Site View To Have Access Control

[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h11m13s)

The reason is like I explained we set the Front Site View that it should have Access control. Which means you can control who sees this page. It is not open to everyone but you can say only this group can see it, or only that group can see it. Since we haven't set that and by default doesn't allow anyone. Now we set that it's by default should be public, but like I explained when I gave you that heads up, [01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h11m49s) it only sets the default the first time the Component is installed. It is the way you should ship the Component. If you only add that feature later, you need to do Custom Scripting in the script area. Which is beyond Hello World Component tutorial to update a Database and ensure that this view is public. 

### Manual Way To Change Access Control

[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h12m13s)

The manual way to do this is to go to the Hello World Component, click on Options. Then go to Permissions scroll down to the area where you see Greetings (site) Access. Select the Public group and change Greeting (site) Access to Allowed. This will now ensure that the Site area is available to the public. Having refreshed the Public area we know see James, Williams, Sarah, and Koos,  all of them loading as expected. 

## Adding A Link

[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h13m00s)

Let's add a link to James so that when you click it you see the Greeting that James should receive. We go back to the Site Views and we open the Greetings. Now we want to add a link. But there is a better way of doing a link in JCB which takes care of all the [01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h13m27s) controller issues. When I go to the front end of the Component then we open the models for greetings.php, we will see that there is the getItems method. And in it, we are checking whether this item has an alias. If it does have an ($item->id) and an ($item->id), it creates what is known as a $item->slug. This ($item->alias) and ($item->id) is combined [01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h13m58s) into the $item->slug. Since we know that our greetings area does not have an alias. It only has an id. It will only end up with an id in the slug. 

### Adding An Alias

[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h14m11s)

Let's go add an alias to our Greeting. There is a shortcut to the Fields linked to an Admin area. It's this little icon underneath Greetings. We want to add another Field called Alias. If you go to the Fields we'll see that there is already a Field called Alias. We can simply use that Field. Go back to the Admin Views and we'll click on this shortcut icon underneath Greetings for adding fields. We going to [01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h14m52s) click the green plus button and add an Alias. We going to tell the system that this is an Alias. Now we are moving(alignment) both of these Above Tabs. We are creating the Alias to be second in line. In the Greetings, we are going to make it full width in Alignment. [01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h15m18s) 

We also going to go edit the Greetings in a moment so that it's no longer a text field but a text area. We got all in its place, save and close. Going back to Fields, I'm going to open the Greetings. Since there are some values I want to stay the same. I am going to select [01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h15m51s) the XML Definition and I'm going to copy it. Then I'm going to select Textarea. I'm going to paste that first XML in here. We have to remove it again but just so I can copy, paste. [01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h16m13s) Cut the name. I want to keep the same name. You can't change the type because the Type up at the top of the page needs to correspond with the type in the XML. Changing the type in the XML will not work. The label you want to keep that the same. We want to add greetings as a description. We don't want to default text. [01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h16m57s) Let's add the hint back again. We don't need any of these other fields, so we can just remove them. We don't want the filter to be set to raw. We would rather use the word string. Since we don't want any HTML at this stage in our greetings. If you want HTML now in the greeting you can use the Save HTML. I see it's not in this list but it does exist. Usually, we would use the editor instead of just a textarea. [01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h17m43s) We got our textarea replace and I'm going to add 'class.'text_area span 12'. I don't know how long that's going to still be there as a class. I think it is still there. I think that should do it. Save and close. [01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h18m11s) Since we didn't change any of the Database values with this text field, we shouldn't have any issues. But we did add a new text field. If we go to the  Compiler and we compile the Component, you will see that it dynamically incremented the version 2_0_1. If we go without installing we go to the Component you will see that it hasn't updated the view because this was open.  Before doing anything I would suggest reopening the view, refresh the page.  So that the changes will show. 

### Install The New Changes

[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h19m01s)

We can go back and install the new changes. If we go to a Hello World we should be able to open the Hello World and we should see the Alias there and if we click save, it should dynamically add a new Alias. We'll have to do this for every item because the Aliases are saved or created only once you saved the item. I'm just opening all of them quickly. Usually, a user using your Component, you only going to ship this Component when you've got everything in place. They wouldn't have to do all this gymnastics to make sure that all the values are in place. If by some reason you will have to help them along with some Custom Scripting. [01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h19m58s) Now that we got all our items set and it has an Alias, we can start working on those links. 

### Changes To Be Made In Dynamic Get - Including Alias

[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h20m07s)

There's one more place we need to make a change. That is in the Dynamic Get. If you remember when we set it up we didn't include the Alias. I'm going to copy this(see video). I then change to another view quickly and then back to this one so that we can get the alias there. Here is the alias that we want. We don't need all these. We can just add that over there. There we go. We got the alias. Select save and close.  

### Check Whether Alias Brought To page By Adding a php.var_dump

[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h20m46s)

We can check whether this alias is being brought to the page by adding a php.var_dump. [01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h21m11s) We take all the $this>items, copy, paste it in there php.var_dump($this>items) and save. Now we go back to the Compiler. I'm just quickly compiling this again and install. Go to the homepage [01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h21m44s) refresh and now you will see that it dumps all the values on the page and then displace them. We can look and see there's the Alias and it created that slug we spoke about. We got the slug for every item and that is the first step in setting up a well-form link for opening one of these items. [01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h22m13s) I don't know what some of you might think,  that's got a lot of things to do to get this to work. I can tell you if you want to build Components for Joomla and you want to go outside of the box and build things that are unique and completely different from what other people are doing and this is just the basics. 

### Use PHP For Creating A Link

[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h22m36s)

We going to set up a href here around this name. But we are going to use PHP to take care of creating a link for us. Here we are simply going to say PHP echo. I'm going to go and show you where we get the class name for what we want to do here. Back in the code, you will see that there is in the helpers class a [01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h23m11s) file called route.php. You can open that and you'll see that you have what is now called Hello_worldHelperRoute. If you scroll down, we don't have this stage have. Oh yes, we haven't added the site view for the single record. So some values are missing here. I should have first done that. I'll go do that now, but we'll come back to this file. There is another file or I should say class that works together with this class . [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h23m48s) It's these two classes with their methods that we were going to use to build our link. 

### Create Site View For The Single Record

[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h23m56s)

Let's create that display Site View. So I've removed the var_dump from this view. I'm going to save and close this. I could have set save a new.  I'm going to create another Site View. We are going to call this Greet. We can't call it greeting because like we said there is already a greeting in the front. Or Greeted that one might be better. We going to make a nice display here. I'm using [01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h24m40s) Panel. I'm going to copy the Panel Snippet and paste it in Default View. The title I'm going to make the name. The content will be the greeting. Now I don't want two of those, so I'm going to take out this one. [01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h25m08s) I got one greeting setup here. There are no buttons here yet to edit it. But he will view one Greeting. It will also show you who set up the greeting. We can close this. We got this Greeted Site View. We can go to the Admin area [01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h25m36s) of the Joomla Component area. I'm going to click on Edit. And add a Site View to the Component. The same way we did before. Can I say I want Greeted. I don't want it to have an Add Menu. It must have Has Metadata. [01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h25m59s) It's not a Default View. I also want Access there. By Default it's not Public. Save and close. We'll Compile the Component again. I've compiled and install it. 

### Back In The Code

[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h26m24s)

If we now go back to the that file I just opened previously, this Hello_worldHelperRoute and we scroll down  we will see that it now has a method called greetedRoute. You basically pass it and id and it constructs the URL for you. This Component view doesn't have category. So it will skip this area. But it's a function that I [01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h26m54s) wrote that should be able to work for any view. You want to use this method and this abstract class. Those of you that are [01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h27m11s) a little bit interested in how this works, you'll see in the Main File of the Site View, you'll see that the route is also added as a helper class. This is the name of this helper class. Hello_worldHelper Route. That's the abstract class name.  

### Back To Site View To Add Link

[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h27m39s)

Going back to our Site View of Greetings to add our link. Let's get the method name. We go back, scroll down, getGreetedRoute is the method name. We can [01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h28m05s) copy it. It needs to be corresponding to the view we want to open. It's going to be a ($item->slug). That's not the only function that we want to call here. There is another one I mentioned [01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h28m40s) which works alongside this and it's called the JRoute class. We would add the JRoute around this first method class and that would add the other values to the URL [01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h29m01s) that is required. We've got our own helper class of a Component. We give it a slug which then gives it to the JRouter and then echos out the link to open this item. [01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h29m20s) Let's save this and compile again. To see it in action we go to the front and reload the page. When we click on one of these James, William, Sara, Koos it says not authorized to view Greeted. That means this specific group are not allowed to look at this. There are ways to prevent the link from showing up in the first place. [01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h29m51s) But this is for some reason you didn't put that custom script in to place. 

### See How Back end Generates In The Code

[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h29m58s)

You can see how the back end generates some of this. If I go into the code and we go to the administrator area of the hello world component and we open  views and then greetings and we open the default_body.php and we open the view.html.php. You'll see that it is grabbing some permissions to know whether it should show certain buttons. And then in default_body.php again is setting up some permissions to see whether [01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h30m48s) you are allowed to edit the greeting. If you're not allowed to edit it, it just echoes the name. You see it doesn't show you the link. So this area here(see video) is a demonstration of what you want to do in the front. [01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h31m11s) You don't want it to always show the link to the item unless the person who is viewing the site, is in the correct group of the site to be able to view the item. I'm not going to spend more time on this part because we want to also do an editing concept [01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h31m31s) which is really more interesting and what I would rather spend time on. I'm just going to go back into the admin view in the admin area and just change the permissions that the actual public could still open this view for now. In the back end I go to Options of the Hello World Component Permissions, scroll down. Again I'll see there is a new one called Greeted (site) Access,  [01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h31m58s) change this to Allowed for the Public group. Save and close out of there. 

### Quick Demonstration To Setup A Front-End

[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h32m05s)

If I go back to the front and click on this link James, it opens it and it gives us the name James. It gives us the Welcome to JCB and the greetings were set by Super user. It loads it as we expected. You can also see in the  URL this demo site of mine isn't fully search engine friendly setup, but it already generates that this is a greet to James. And so And the name James appears here because of the slug. The slug is used to generate the search engine optimization here. If we didn't have an alias it would have given you one or two depending on the item ID. [01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h32m58s) That just gives you a quick demonstration of how to setup a front-end that can open specific items. 

###  Next Step: To Make Items Editable

[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h33m07s)

The next step is to make these items editable. Like I explain to you in the admin area we're already doing some of this. I'm going to just copy and paste most of the code from the admin area. I would encourage you to do the same unless you know enough that you can just do it without looking at how JCB did it. I'm going to copy the string(see video) and then I'm going to also copy these few lines. I'm also going to use some of these(see video). 

### Checkout Value Needs To Be Set On Page

[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h33m57s)

I realize by looking at this first area that this checkout value needs to be set on the page. I also need to make sure about this(user.>id) value because we need to check the users authority on the page. We need to check whether the user is set on the page. We can go and do that and look at some code. I'm going to move some of this code [01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h34m27s) and then we'll go to the front end of the code area.

### Add The Option To Edit In Both List And Single View

[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h34m32s)

I want to add the option to edit the item in both the list as well as the single view. I'm going to do it in the List view first and that I'll demonstrate step-by-step. And then when we go to the Single view, I'm just going to place the code in place. I'm not going to explain to much because it's the same. 

### List View - Add PHP Script

[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h34m52s)

In the Site view of the List area I'm going to PHP and I'm going to Add PHP (custom view script). It says add PHP script to the head of the file.  I'm going to paste this link in here and we see that it has this view greetings, and the task is greeting, edit. That is the task and it's going to be available in the edit variable. That's the first part of the code we want up on the page. [01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h35m29s) Now for the rest of it we go back to the admin view again, the back end. We see wither we need to grab these as well. Before grabbing them let's open the corresponding site view so we can look at some of the code. Here is the greetings. [01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h35m55s) I'm going to open this view.html.php and we'll see that the user is already being loaded onto the page. This is the $this.>items. It is always good for you to go and look at the code the JCB is writing. Seeing the code is what makes you familiar with how things work and also helps you to detect when something doesn't work. Why? [01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h36m29s) and how to fix it. Since we know that the user is on the page and we go to the default_body.php area. We see that it's accessing the user in the same way. Using this($this.>user) as an object, user and ask him whether it has authority on the core [01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h36m48s) managed to check in. Then also it checks and gets the check out user details. We'll see why in a moment. But we don't have the check out user on the page.   

### Update Dynamic Gets

[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h37m06s)

What we going to do it's we going to quickly also get those values by going to the Dynamic Get and making sure that those values get brought to the page as well. We go to ListGreetings and again like before we just copy all those values and just tweak away and then back. The values we now want to make sure also comes along is basically I see it's a value that it doesn't by itself add to the selection. [01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h37m44s) But you can add it in because you know it is in the Database. It's just that this View Table Selection only shows at this stage the actual values that it knows belongs to the view. I need to update this in JCB. It is a little tweak which I haven't done. So it's not showing the checked_out and checked_out by values. You can type it in.  [01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h38m16s) Those values will also be brought to the front of this view. The checked_out and the checked_out time, we don't need the check_out_time. Only the check_out, basically who checked it out. [01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h38m43s) Save and close. We've updated our Dynamic Get and that means our values are on the page and we can move our code into place. 

### Editing Echoing Edit Link

[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h38m57s)

We'll need to add it inside of this(Default View) for each loop since this code is working with the item itself. We've got the code in there, we are calling the user, we also checking the item check_out to the user id. [01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h39m21s) Making sure it's 0. We checking whether to check_out user. Let's go get the rest of the code we need. So again in the admin view we going to go with this area here and just copy that(see video). We want to make a few adaptations because in the end of the day the front end is a little different from the back end. [01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h39m54s) The back end only displays an edit view. The front-end displays a read view. We want to make it a little different. You can pause the video to see some of the things I've done here. But in simple terms I basically got the edit here. I'm editing echoing the edit link. I'm adding the item and I'm putting in a little icon which then you can click. I'm checking whether you have permission to edit [01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h40m34s) this item. If we were to save this and refresh the homepage, it should not change anything because the public doesn't have permission to edit it at this stage. That icon should be pencil not edit. Let's save this and compile it to see it in action. Install it and we reload the home page and as you can see it doesn't show those little buttons. If we go to the back end [01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h41m17s) and we go to options, we change that the public is allowed to edit. Let's just do that they allowed to edit. Let's open the front again. We know see that it shows the edit [01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h41m48s) pencil. Let's click on that and we see it opens the edit area where it can now add the exclamation and click on save. Save and close. It tells us that the message was saved successfully. If we now [01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h42m12s) open that greeting, we see that has the exclamation. Our attempt to integrate or to make our items editable on the front end within the control of permission groups, has worked very effectively. If we again revoke the permissions and [01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h42m35s) refresh the page, and then suddenly those links are gone. Even if somebody were to try and circumvent the system by having in the URL paste in the link to edit that specific item and it will say that it's not permitted. [01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h42m57s) The  permissions structure is armed and will protect the item from being edited by that group. Again we gave the Public Permission to edit but now the question is can we also give it permission to create? 

### Add Option To Create

[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h43m17s)

Going back to greetings. Let's add an option to create an item. If I go and add this button with a link to create an item, but I'm not adding any checks around it. You basically need the same kind of check as you've using here($canDo->get9core edit') except that there are some [01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h43m42s) shortcut. Let me show you. Around the button we added this php that checks the users authority to create for the core of this component. If yes then it will show the button, if no the button will not show. That is to control the visibility of the button. Let'05s save this and then compile and install [01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h44m11s) to see it in action. We see the button doesn't show and that is because currently we've got a component set that the public cannot create. If we allow creating for the public [01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h44m40s) and we refresh the page. You will see that it shows. If we click on it, it will open an area where we can create an item. Here we can set a new name [01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h45m06s) and save and close. We get this 'Save not permitted'. This must mean that we haven't granted enough permissions for the public user to create an item. Giving it the option to create an item is not enough because there are fields that [01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h45m28s) you need also access too before you can create an item. Let's try again. But first giving it more permissions. We've granted it all the permissions that it needs and go to the front. Now we click 'Create A Greeting' save and close. [01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h45m53s) We have saved the item, we can again edit the item, we can close, and we can view, as you can see it's all working as expected. Our Hello World tutorial is nearly at it's end. [01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h46m16s) 

### Demonstrated - List Items, Open Individual Items, Edit Items, Create New Items

We have within this tutorial demonstrated to you how to create a Hello World Component. List its items, open individual items, edit those items, as well as creating new items. All based on the permissions of structures of the Component. [01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h46m40s) If we where to change these permissions back to not allowed and we now refresh the front, we'll see that we can only view the items. Even more if we go back and we want to control the actual viewing of the Greeted items, not be visible to the public but maybe only to managers we could do that. [01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h47m06s) You can manage that kind of control over your items without a lot of custom code. If you click on it, it will tell you don't have authority to view it. You can add Custom Scripting to remove the link that it doesn't even look clickable if the person doesn't have access to view it. [01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h47m32s) 

We gone so far over the time trying to demonstrate to you some of the basic principles of setting up a Hello Component in JCB. I trust you've enjoyed this tutorial. By far it doesn't usually take this long to build a Hello World Component. In fact there is a older tutorial where we managed to build a Hello World Component in a very shorter time. [01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h48m02s) I illustrated and demonstrated and explain it a little more here to help you guys along to build components with JCB and that you'd realize that JCB is a very powerful application. I mean I haven't even gone to the code this time, and shown you all that it's written, but I mean just from the compiler we already got 13000 lines of code. Which would have taken you 5-8 hour days to write. [01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h48m37s) Which is about 39 hours and I think for a basic component that's quite a lot of code and it's because that it's already integrating a lot of permissions structures and version control. I mean if I was to open the Greetings and open James, [01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h49m03s) remember we added that little exclamation mark. We could check the version. We can see the changes and when it was made. We can review some of the previous versions and we can even go back to those versions. That kind of integration with your History Component is done automatically by just adding history. And so is many of the other features [01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h49m30s) that JCB is adding to your Component. Like export and import of data. Batch changes that you can make. As well as a whole lot of other concepts which is beyond the scope of what we had time for today. Well enjoy coding and yes if you have any issues, please go to GitHub. [01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h49m58s) First check out the wiki page, check the tutorials and if you think you've discovered a bug, you're most welcome to open an issue and we'll see what we can do in trying to resolve that for you. We would like to invite other PHP Programmers to get involved on the JCB GitHub [01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=01h50m22s) Community and help us improve JCB so that it can become a home for us to manage the troubled waters of open-source development. Thank you.
