I would like to give you a tutorial on how to build a hello world Component With Joomla component Builder Joomla component Builder Is a Jamar component Which Helps you to develop Jumla components Quite easily Originally developed this application or extension For myself just so that I can Maintain the code In a very consistent And Shareable way For example since there are lot of Concepts in any components that build that you build for Joomla Which we could call conventions or Boilerplate Implementation These things are usually always the same And so I wanted something like a wire frame That could just take care of all that for me all the time and even if Zuma was to change I could just make a change in one place And then compile it into all my components that have developed And then just have them Run Again stable on Joomla I said of having to go to every one of those components and that means We've gone Beyond Just developing The most basic parts of a component with actually gone and ventured into some of its complex And that is why Even showing you and hello world Component Being built by JCB Jamal component Builder It is still gonna end up being quite an advanced Component Now Since I've really mentioned to you that I really build JCB for myself And it wasn't originally intended as a community project just something that I was wanted to use It has since become a community project and the code is open on GitHub And most of you might already know that But it also means that I didn't think about the car Laxity When I was developing the component I just had Desired functionality in mind And I didn't really care that it is complicated to achieve those things Because I said it set the conventions in place Harvesting know how to use them And so That's why JCB On the surface might look just like any other of those component Builders out there But when you start Using it and Knowing some of its secrets It actually is amazing how conventions Even Conventions that you would Use when you develop components yourself Wood Actually make tasty do things that are quite amazing So you will end up realising that JCP has actually a ton of functions Most of them will most of the basic ones of those we have tried or I have tried O2 Explain in the tutorials that you can find on YouTube You can actually access to tutorials from this link here Looking at the toriel Would be The most Easiest way For you to discover some of JCB Hidden secrets What is the same time It really is only the basics although it's quite a lot of Tutorials end I know that I usually Yeah I love rate more than Mike maybe is necessary And yet That's because I wanna make sure that you are able to not only Do basic things but even advanced things Have you come to JCP and you do not have PHP As a as a language But you don't know it well And you do not know jamalife API Then You shouldn't expect to build complex components with JCB Complexity is only possible with JCB The More You Know Yourself Because the more you know the more you would have that perspective on how to How this implementation should function And most of the time if you do have that perspective You would start knocking and opening the correct doors And set up the correct relationships To have those conventions dynamically You know be built for you Buy JCB If you are very good at PHP programming and you do know the Jeweller API You should be very happy to Simply go into the compiler And really start reading the code The compilers codes files are actually Alphabetically ordered ABCD And so you can start with a and work your way down So the first one is a underscore get the PHP and so forth Reading this code and understanding how JCB is compiler Constructs the code with send you on a treasure hunt where you would discover amazing features That work just out of a box And yet having this under the hood I realise we all need to start with the basics And that is Just to build a hello world tauriel Just to know how to Actually Combine The different Concepts That is required for a component To be fully functional And portable And useful And that's really what I want to actually Give you a tutorial of In this video There are two concepts which I want to mention before we start One of his patients the other one is perseverance I know within any programming career These are invaluable Aspects Which if you have them L make the whole difference whether you are only a normal programmer Or an extremely good programmer You see because those of us who have stuck around Nf just been going at it We have realised that many Michael centre is being genius And yet It's only because it's the skies by perseverance Because we continually try and try and try Until we resolve or succeed This is what has made Jason be possible And this is also what would make you successful In using JCP It is not a component which I can claim has no Uno internal conflicts or has no Inconsistencies But it is most certainly a component with which I am I self Have developed countless Mini Programs components itself from it Which I am maintaining And I am planning to Start Pushing some of these components into the community It's just that I have not seen the need for doing so yet For the initial development were mostly For clients who has directly Approached me Now Having said all this Let me take you through the basic steps Building one piece one another So did you would Fully understand How to build A component In JCB I think it's self explanatory That you would need a g Muller website Distri molar website with preferbly B On a developing environment which is Hi there offline Or on a server Which isn't necessarily Uno used in production This is not because JCB itself is on se4 Any of that is simply just it's more convenient If you have an offline You can open the code in your ID And since JB JCB has the feature to extract this customised code out of your pump Poland And put it back into your component on compilation A feature which will not be discussed during this tutorial What does exist A local developing environment is most ideal for this I know that you could with Certain Yeah Pro2Call Set up a Tunnel between your desktop and Your life server And still have this kind of interaction of editing code live And then compiling and Sing changes And that's all good because if you're able to manage that kind of complexity I don't need to tell you anything about how to set up an environment But what I would suggest though Is that when you are busy trying to install JCB And there is Some limitations in a shared hosting environment That I would Encourage you to try and first resolve that Old movie development offline So When you go to gym allow website ready obviously you would login Having logged in Would first need to install JCP So I'm simply gonna go to manage and install How many ways for you to install JCB you could download the package you can grab the euro From get up You could also Install it From the web It is listed with Joomla Now if you type in JCB and search You're actually Brings up JCB here But It would not necessarily always do that I've recently discovered If I type in Component builder which is actually it's name in the listing It doesn't even come up Which to me was wow Good and understand how that happens If you do not find a component in the surge This is the component Then you could go down to An area Call tools And then Developing tools JCB is one of the listed developing tools Here it is only listed as a component Builder So you can click on that And simply click Install This will then grab a URL from GitHub This is the same URL You could have just used here As you can see That would have done the same thing But we can use the double R Installer And simply click install This would depend on your own network Well faster steaks it could take a while This is quite a big file And it's part of the places where they might be Limitation If used Outside of a local developing environment Ok we've got Jason be installed Now let's open it There's just a few small things that we need to slow down Restaurant Asian stones In understanding how a component Basically most Joomla component Are constructed We're Gonna Build A component called hello world The way to setup a component Is you need to first understand fuel types Then you need to set up the fields you'll need And then you need to set up the views That you want in your component These views also map Back to the database These are what we call admin views So you up and views Have feels and these are usually your Database Collins So these are your database tables Pizza your database columns And these Our your field types so you got a text healed radio List Multiple selection Checkbox datefield You got many types of fields But each field independently Is linked to a type But also there are some database settings within each field As it gets linked into the admin View Since the fields Form the columns of the tables of the admin views This is how you set up a component Once you set it up or per component Then You basically are done with Would have a we would call the back end The backing of the component is what always needed to be done First Well you could Argue differently But the point is within JCB you first build a backend And then only add in the front end And the front-end usually Doesn't have its own database it actually pulls it's data From the backend Database Now Having explain some of that Let's show you this in action So in JCP It already ships with quite a lot of field types So we open the fuel types area You see that there are many field types already setup JCB is built in a way that it can be extended Like subform Is a new field type which was recently introduced into Joomla community It also replaces an old fuel type Called repeatable fields Repeatable fields in a field type I would encourage you not to use anymore Since most of you might know Jason be used repeatable field squad excessively And yet due to the fact that you more lies now discontinuing this field type We had to Migrate all of our repeatable Fields to subform Fields and it was an amazing Huge Process But yes part of the reason why I'm redoing the hello world tutorial It's because of the fact that subforms are now being used all across JCB And there's been a little few changes And how things are implemented So here you can see all the sub this field types that I've been Set up in JCB already You could always add new field types So as JCB Uno continues and Joomla continues to Evolve and become better at what it does So we will be adding more fuel types And whenever we would be Confronted by fuel type That needs a little bit of extra tweaking within the compiler My dear I would hope to be a head of all of you most of the time in adding that field You type in there if it needs that Most of the time fuel types do not need Extra help It's only field that likes up form that actually does What field types like you're old and Text and tell and Sequel tag it needed some extra help But most of these don't Because basically the way I feel type works Is that it really helped you set up what we know as the properties So The property has a name It has a default value It is either adjustable knot adjustable It's Monday or not Mandurah translatable and then you can give it a little description So that when you use the fuel type You can always come back to this This information can be gathered from going through the Jumla core Libraries Because this field types really only mapping Jo Malone Implementation of these field types Failure to open a fuel type that's already been created like the text field You see that these properties already there and in place so the field Type Is text The name is any text When we say that the type is text Then this is not just the bill So We need this on text if it is adjustable we can kick it It most certainly Mandatory And so That is how you set up fuel types I'm not gonna go into this too deep Since there is extra tutorials on how to do field types I just wanted to give you a brief overview Or the fact that the most of the fuel types already are created and ready for you to use So you'd most of the time simply start with feels There are quite a few Fields already here But I'm gonna go on as they are not there And I'm gonna create Basically two or three Fields that we can use in our hello world component So First fuel I'm gonna create Click on new Then I'm gonna select Text as my field type and you see That information in the field type You know Mandatory in everything all this information here It is actually brought in by Ajax From the fuel type So if I was to click on this button here Just do it give you quickly mistration And I was 2 Just say change this to TT Like 3 of them and save and close And then go back to fields And click new Then select Text field again You see that now it added Treaties in there Because this whole structure is being built From the field types default settings Which we just looked at So I'm gonna go change that back quickly I maybe just put a little Something in here the description For you to see What I mean So creating a field we haven't really started with it I've just been the mist trading the fuel type but ok Ok I'm gonna take text again And I you see those hours are showing up here So this means that this whole area Is actually dynamically populated from the values that are put up in the fuel type And so is this XML structure re here Usually Populated with the demo Or default values that you add it When you created the fuel type The JCB ships with most fuel types or ready in place it appears like this is something weird But really it's something that you can extend and even change So for example if you know that the text field type has more properties then we have setup You can go in and add more to it You can simply click on this and you know it it here or before creating a field You can go to the field types And open the text area Sorry too Text field type And Here just click The green button and add more Properties And then those properties will dynamically also appear Within The area where you create the fields So this again is just Wanting to show you The JCB is tried it's very best To be scalable And basically customisable To your Own desires So that it isn't just Locked in To what we have said hard into code But it is movable and therefore scalable So having Looked at Field types I think enough Let's create a first field So it's gonna be a text field we gonna call it greetings So I'm gonna update the label with greetings This is what Will be visible In the database Greetings Singular is gonna be the database name I'm gonna leave most of the others just default Let's see Autocomplete is on Validation You know We can leave all the doors It doesn't really matter let's just maybe change the hint Ok And then also gonna just remove the description Definitely take out the default text otherwise it always Pure And now what did you go to the database That is what these features are all about Since text Fields can differ We didn't come Out and say well all of them gonna be this size We left it up to you to decide What kind of takes two of this is gonna be And really it's all up to you Obviously that would mean that you would need to know a little bit more about MySQL and databases To really effectively use this Most of the time it is available on Google so if you do not know What would be the best for A text field or a date field You can Google that Or you could simply go and look at do Malaysian implementation It's got an article manager And you can go into its XML Database And look at What Database Values was used and yours use the same Whatever be the case You should be able to actually navigate through this Without much problems Since that is what is would be required You need to Afriserv earons you need to You know Be curious Dick through things And doing that you will eventually succeed Because these values are movable That means that setting them wrong Break things And That's why I always encourage those who gonna use JCB To really do a little bit homework And to prepare themselves To get involved in programming More effectively That would only Be beneficial to all of us I suppose Because good programmers makes good programs And makes the web a safer place So Having crazy our first field I think I'm gonna just read username And maybe Also description Those are part of the demo Component but since Fields can be linked into any admin view and therefore belong To any component It doesn't bother the fact that it is linked to the demo component already What is the true He said if you change it It'll actually affect both Components Ok so Having created HR field types And also now a field Let's create a admin View Open views as I already explained Is really the back in of your component And So you'd need to do some thinking and maybe draw some up Leshole A lot of tutorials around the web about object orientated development Which talks about use cases and All kinds of discussions and trying to sort of Come up with a Perspective of what do you wanna build how should it work what should be wear what should have its own classes What would have it on tables where we gonna put what And really that kind of work you need to do before coming to JCB JCB Isn't really gonna help you that And so Once you've got all that planned Then you would come here great two Fields great admin views which basically should tables And then link them to a component And once you've done that You've basically later foundation of your application And you can start working on what will make it unique And special which is the front end So first Admin View This is the name is really just for you to identify The View If there be more than one view with the name greetings So let's say you've Built quite a few components that deals with all the world And now you got three or four different Variations of greetings Now you might want to just say ok this is the first One And By doing that It's identifiable within the drop down list across your application of JCB You'll see that when we would later select the greeting that the system name is used in the drop down low So we gonna have a single record and a list record Single record is also what we understand is the edit View So that's when you are looking at 1 record And you are editing that record In the admin area that's the single record That's also What will be used when you Actually tweak JCB To add an edit option To the site area of your Website Since JCB can do that for you On the fly This single record Would also affect The front end of your component in that case Which we will show in demonstrate As we go along So for now I'm just gonna call this Greeting Andalus record Goody readings Obviously we want to have the ability to read and write to this table Now when we say this is a read only It means that the data is in the actual admin area is not gonna be able to be changed Via Joomla Unless obviously you add it some JavaScript and some Other nice Conventions around your component that sort of grades data for that area Dynamically as people use the component Which that case you might use this feature but I must tell you I have hardly ever used it I'm not even sure why I added it but it's there and I know maybe some of you might find it use This basically turns all the fields in the area as read only And when you try and change them they never get But you know submitted to the database So we would bite by Default always leave it to read and write Then you give it a short description We'll go to settings and we'll see That Sorry Fields and conditions We'll see that this button to create admin field conditions will show once the atom View Safe for the first time So you cannot add Fields to the Saturn Vue if you haven't saved it That is one of the changes that now came in from us moving away from repeatable Fields to subform fields B admin View Is it table on its own And it's relationship with the fields is also a table on its own So at this stage Unfortunately you need to first not click save and close but just save once So that it basically create this atman view in the database And now If you go to fields And conditions you'll be able to link Fields and create conditions We are not gonna be creating conditions since we are basically illustrating or demonstrating a very basic We just gonna create A linked fields Link fields are basically the fields that we created previously So we will click on create It's gonna ask us to be sure that all our work is been saved in the admin View Because if it isn't and we click ok It will be lost So make sure your work is saved before you clicking ok This will now open an area where you can link Fields to your admin View This looks very similar to the pop-up we had with repeatable Fields except That it's basically it's own View now So if we click on this green Button here It opens An area where we're all select The fields we wanna use So we gonna have a name field And That's a text field We wanted to show in the afternoon if you We wanted to show first we gonna have it behave as a title You wanted sortable searchable Not filtered Bill because then every name would be a filter that's too much But they're pretty linkable this means if someone Clicks on the name it will open the greeting so You can edit it Now We only have two tabs at this stage I'm gonna go into great detail about the tabs This Time Round If you want to know more please go through the tutorials and look up Tabs to to see more on this subject I'm gonna let it be In the left In the tub And in the tub I wanted to be the first item I'm not gonna add any permissions to this But there is an editing permission available at this stage If you wanted to That would create permissions around this Field Which you can tweak who can edit it and who can't You can also control this from a global view perspective Or on a field level These are some of the hidden advantages the JCB has In Handling permissions across your component quite easily Now The Next Field you wanna add is greetings We want the greetings to also be in the listview And we wanted to be second Wanted to be searchable Sortable and searchable And doesn't need to be a link We wanted to be on the right Hand in the tub and we wanted to be first And sure that's basically All We Need And they will kick save and close This will now basically link those Fields to this atman view We now again open the fields and conditions We will see that those fields are here And with all the variations that we have selected Ready-to-use Ok so having our admin view setup We can actually now go and create our component So we can Hi there Clicks Avon close Or we can simply click clothes We haven't made any changes in this view since we've come back This area is already been saved So we could click close But clicking save and close it's always the safe choice I suppose So Now that are open view is in place Let's go crazy component Click new We're getting gonna give our component a system name Since this is the second hello world tutorial recorded this into Now we also gonna give it a name which Is the same as the first one Hello world We gonna give it a code Name of Hollow world And his virgin True Am I gonna explain too much about all these other switches Basically just that we will need to add company names Author name email website And a short description How did we have those in place The next thing to do would be to add an admin View Assist the admin view can only be at it once two components been saved For the first time Let's save it Great all component has been saved Opening the app and view when how can link Admin views to this component Tattoo places to do this Under settings You can click on component admin View I can click on this one here Or you could in the admin views click on create Both these buttons take you to the same place This used to be The Old Way In how people would add admin views to their component And that's why we left it here But within the new JCB after all transition away from repeatable fields We actually can handle all of it within the admin tab at The View tab Just click create We are sure we have saved all our work so we can click ok Again we are faced with something that looks very similar to when we were linking the fields Accepted now We are dealing with the up and do Linking admin views to this component So I'm gonna click on this plus button here To open our first line We basically just wanna Link The greeting We gonna leave the default icon Of Joomla But they are a whole list of icons available These icons Are I con moons which are the Joomla default icon That are part of the Joomla backend And front-end I suppose And you can search this Just Search that phrase I suppose And you will find out on Tomorrow's website A hole Picture map of all these icons Then I most certainly want this view to be Part of the main menu I want an add record On the dashboard I want a list That means clicking on something and it shows us the list of greetings I wanted in the submenu CO2 check-in feature Basically Components get checked out when somebody Not components items So when you Create a record That are stored in the database and someone else comes and wants to edit that the record You wanna prevent people from working on the same record at the same time Since one of them is gonna lose their work So July has this feature by which You can check out an item And then when someone else tries to open it it tells them hey sorry it's not been it's not available it's Checked out The problem with seeing the is that this check out Can be problematic Because people don't save They just open it maybe to have a look at it And then instead of clicking cancel or close They just click back And the item doesn't get check the back into the database So the auto check-in feature is a nice add-on that jcps Same place Which basically you can set that an item Which are checked out longer than a day Is obviously one that was missed And should be checked in automatically This Is one of the reasons why I developed JCB because I have all these The tweaks that I Want in all my views but I Know that If you wanna change the something and I need to change this little tweak Going to every single single view is like so cumbersome I'm sorry hear it simply click weather you would like this And if Joomla makes a change that we need to know that this feature we just change it in the compiler and it Immediately you know compiles correctly for all the components mapped in it The other feature which I think is also great is this keeping of History If I want to keep track of all the changes made to the any item of greeting Then I just need to take this Keep history And JCB will dynamically add all the needed structures so the Joomla Integrate a history component we work alongside your third-party component And keep track of every item and it's changes So that is just a tick box and JCB does to work The app The has metadata basically adds The metadata Fields to the view So you don't need to add them it gets added just by ticking this box Then also does this feel view have access public Special law Uno registered All these access levels Do you want to implement these levels of access on this view usually you would use this If you want the view to be actually be editable on the front end of the site Because then you will use the access To control some of these I'll show you more of that as we go along So I'll just take this as yes I wanted to have an import function And like we said We want to add a site edit and create view for this admin View Yes And then We wanted to be first So this happens you basically is gonna have all the features that an admin view can have By Default in JCB And how she would realise when we start them was trading it although it's as easy as taking this parks The code that JCB is gonna write two to this implementation Is quite stable And yet Dynamic that as Jason as tumor levels and changes We can tweak these codes In the compiler and make sure that it remains stable this way Good now save and close Now that we have linked the Saturn Vue to the component We can all go to Athens views and we'll see this atman view Will even see the icon we can click on this Blue pencil here and this will actually take us to the admin View Obviously again making sure that all your work is being saved in this area Click ok if it is And you'll see that it opens the admin view where we linked The fields And we can actually how work in the atman view From the component Now there are areas in the admin view I didn't they must write like the permissions the tabs the link two views And I'm not going to going to do much of that I'm just gonna add Some permissions Because I want to demonstrate The promotional structure Regarding the front in management of editing these items I'm just gonna use the core there is the option of using what is known as the view edit Instead of core edit then it means it's relationship is just for this view I wanted to be related to the Core Which means that it's not gonna be I only related to this view But whatever I changed in the Corps will affect his view Mooring explanation on the permissions there is this tutorial Which is available in the description And you can go watch this tutorial And also Maybe do some changes compiled the component And look at the code Look at the code and look at the code that's all I can say for most questions being asked because the code Really tells you what it's been done There is many ways for you to learn How JCB does things By making changes And then compiling your component and looking at what changed Usually using something like it will be very useful in Discovering the changes There's also a way for you to know where in the compiler the specific code is being created Which I will show you as we continue So since we made changes I'll simply click on save and close And this will take us back to the component So being back in the component We'll see that Everything is still the way we left it And The quite a few things around The admin view which I'm not gonna go into depth During this tutorial I would encourage you to watch the tutorials that are already online For actual explanation on hold his features What did Amos trading at whole world component we have done quite enough Regarding the back end So all that lourie remains It's basically to compile so will click save and close And we'll go to the compiler Select all component And compile Great That means we've just written 9000 lines of code Greater 51 folders in 122 Files And if we were to have manually Written this without any boilerplate to law You know why our script That could help us write all the classes and tables and stuff And it took us 5 seconds to ride one line It would have taken us 25 Hours Or about 3 8 hour days That's a long it would have taken you to do this manually So just right there Jason Beers already so if you're quite a lot of time Now the component can be installed by Simply clicking this button Or Grabbing The euro and going to the Normal installer Because it has actually Compiled a Shippable Joomla component package Which can be installed on any Gmail or component Sorry energy Muller website Now one thing I didn't do Is I didn't actually select A Component image so when are we selected you see there is no image showing as there is with this one So I think I wanna quickly go back Can I clear the temporary folder and just goes select At least the demo components image as our Hollywood component So in the component there is this area to select an image I'm gonna click select And I've selected The devil components package Sis we have something so I'm gonna save and close again And now go back to the compiler And compile it again Now I'm gonna click on install If I don't go here will see that there is now a new component in the Stream on our website And I'm gonna open in a new tab And there we go we got our component installed It has a greetings tab and a add greetings tab We also have not selected images for those So let's quickly do that Gonna go back to the admin views And then the greetings I'm gonna click On greetings First As an admin View And here you see there is a place for icons and the add icon I'm gonna select top So I've selected This little bucket as the icon for greetings I'm gonna just add 14 For adding a greeting with a little Green Plus No we got it to icons I'm gonna click save and close Chanel I've got greetings Set up And I'm gonna gonna go and compile this again That's usually how things go we go make a change We come back to the compiler to compile it install it And go look at the component And Also When it gets little bit more advanced We go that only go and look at the component in Joomla But we also go and look at the code So they we got it the two icons are in place if I click add on greeting We see that there's the name there is a greeting And there's also all these other Fields added by Default So the created and the metadata and the permissions Are all in place That is How you would set up a basic Hello world component Go to the options Will see that it has this Check in timer And you can change it to 5 hours What I explained you know the checks in the items We also have The history version enabled And set to remember 10 versions of any item created As a greeting We also have the permission or structure in place Which includes the greeting Access greetings batch dashboard and so forth Which are all The switch is related to the greetings area So now that we have the admin area basically done Let's continue to The front-end I'm gonna illustrate to you on the front-end how to view greetings That will created how to edit greetings that will create it and how to add more Greetings from the front end to this component Let's close out of the components edit area the first thing we need to do We need to create what is known as a dynamic get there 2 ways to get to the dynamic get Area 1 is to click on this add Dynamic get The others would be basically in the sub menu to go to Dynamic get and then Click new we gonna need to Dynamic gets we gonna need 1 to basically return a list of greetings And then will need one to return one greedy because one the one Dynamic get is gonna writ Return for us all the greetings that are available and published the 2nd 1 is when we click on one of those greetings it should open only that greedy So we gonna use the name as who is being greeted and then the greeting will Will only show when we actually click on the name and then show that individuals Greeting so that's part of how we think about this at this stage then In this area where we can see the full greeting we are gonna add and edit but And in the list area we are gonna add a create button but these create an ad Edit buttons are gonna be controlled by the promotional structure which JCB Puts into your component by you just saying that it should be there so setting up a Dynamic gate is quite easy you first know that ok I'm gonna use a buck interview Which is related to my component and then I'm gonna select that back and we You see it's says your greetings first so like I said before with a system name is what What is used in the dropdowns so here we select greetings First This one is going to bring back a list query we don't want any pig Nation And I really don't need all of this we don't need The acid ID We can leave the created by And the created We can take out the modified the version we can also leave The heads And the ordering that's fine now The greeting we most certainly don't need in a list we only need the name now Ok let's give it a name that we can sort of identify when we start setting up the side view Recall this List Greetings And then in brackets Name only So we know ok this is what it is going to save that You didn't need to save it we could have just gone right into tweaking the data without saving What the data tweak gives us is it gives us a little bit of control on the writing The JCB will do regarding this query so for example we want it to be Before did Now the ordering is called ordering Hey hey darling So we want to order it Ascending by the the order set in the database The other filter we want to add Is we wanna make sure That it only returns published items So in the Where area replace published And we say equal One day only published values be returned there are some other features Around the tweak area which I suppose goes beyond just in the whole whole whole world component But there are tutorials about this on Joomla sorry on YouTube in that playlist List that are for we referred to quite a few times then there's a joint area which we not gonna use But It is a very nice way of linking to other Phone and tables that I've got any kind of relationship there needs to be in a Asian ship between the main table and the join table but like I said When I'm gonna go into this we are simply going to do the most basic which is what we've got here And we gonna say say when you so we can do and another one The next one is this gonna be a greeting Just simple greeting we wanted to be one item again we gonna do a back and view Again from the greetings list This time we really Want the name and a greeting we can still use the published we don't need to modify Bye We can leave those we don't need ordering we could have left out the head In the previous one we set up now let's do a little tweak to make sure that it Doesn't allow someone to grab An unpublished value By just adding an ID in the URL something ok so that's ok Got this Oh yes Now we need to add a filter We gonna use the ID Basically passing the ID via the URL So the state will be ID and It is gonna be a Id = so that's really what makes the item load Is this filter type and there are many ways to load items And yes this is a little bit more complex than you might wanted to be but believe me It gives you freedom And ability to build quite amazing things And so Please go and watch the tutorial on Dynamic get on GitHub There is actually a place I just show you Call 2 Wiki And in the weekend there is links to all the different tutorials And here's the dynamic get And you you should really watch all of that Even the second one And yeah well mine courage minister really watch everything I have often seen people ask question In the issue area Which are dealt with in the tutorials I'm sorry We all have lot of things to do and so if I don't answer this questions but simply .22 tutorial I hope you understand Ok so we've got another let me get all the value selected that we want and Also how to limit it The tweak is in place And the limiting factors We don't need to join it to any other table with simply Corner Return these values Let me see We could add the username values if we wanted So we wanted to show who created this we could say created by How to joint Click on the joint a database tables not view because we want to use The user Table And we basically want A single Item returned And here it will be Created by And In the joint field it will be B i d And we basically want let's see The username that's it We don't need the ID where it got that so just the username And we could just say Let's call it Creator Or Grief Turd Greeted by ok so he's the one sending the greeting IGo 7 + So now we've got two Dynamic gets a list greeting and a greeting this is what you need to build first base We Again starting at the database looking at What is the date I want on the On the page What do I want to show the people looking at the page And by that determining really what the data is you going to grab from the database And giving it system names That are Identifiable because now The next thing to do is to create a site View How to restart a thing is layouts and templates That all can work together with side views I'm not gonna illustrate that now 40 most rated basically if you want to know more about that look at the two tour On YouTube I'm just simply gotten bold Two side views And yeah let's go ahead and do that Ok the first sight where we gonna call Greetings And we gonna give it a name called Greetings Ana Codename Greetings Now the code name is significant because you don't want to Clash with up and views that you've already created That are gonna be Edit views on the front So since the listview is not being Placed on the front of your component only the edit view that means edit views name Name is greeting So we can't set a code Name For the front called greedy otherwise they will actually Uno conflict So I'm just gonna use greeting and for the Single I'm gonna use greet Ok so Just give you a reason for the nation and why I'm doing things to the way I'm doing it So at little scription here I'm gonna just Place a little Heading And adding it like that will actually mean That this little string will get added to your language file So that's how you create language strings it's just adding the snippet Oh or even just this anywhere in JCB will actually create a language string Ok now we here We are going to select the list greeting and the reason why there are two of these Is it the one is what we will act upon in the compilation the other one is just for you to look So if you end up Let's say in here and click save It will not be playing any role whatsoever in the compilation It will play a role when you export a JCB package but that's a whole different subject and not cream and you You that so yeah good practice would be that these two actually are the same The main and then Ima get but since you can add custom gifts We don't have any customer gets setup so you can't select any but you can add more than just Your normal main gate to a site View You can have a moan main gate and then a bunch of custom gets which brings a whole ton of data to the PE Page from different variations relationships which I know it's a little bit Ayanda hello world component But it is there and it actually does work very well it's just that you need to do some Someone working tutorials and so forth but we want the list greedy and so This list greeting gives us a few Snippets now Do know that the Snippets are really not always accurate because it's very difficult for me to always No exactly how the implementation is gonna work out so I'm giving you a snippet which is how Kawaii expect you to use the data but you can adjust that and this is where your knowledge of PHP will really Really coming to play you should know that this and that little arrow Items is because we are working with an object and the you know what is it Mean and how to use an object and how to interact with an object How to pass over it how to grab its values how to update its values all this is part of your Your own background that you need to bring to JCB JCB is not gonna At this stage crank out customised up and view side views all the way Where does the admin views because my idea was it when it comes to sight views I always wanna do some Something different and I just want to have the ease of getting all the data on the page and then be creative And so I haven't spent much time to make this as automatic as I want to set up off At the back in the net man views because this is really what makes your component different from every other Component out there and here we want to encourage you to really Yes do you do a lot of preparation and thinking about date Structures and relationships because your Dynamic get can grab from so many data places And bring all that data to you in a nice object which you can and pass and display With a lot of promotional switches as I will show you in a moment so that is giving you little back draw Drop on why the dynamic get and the site view even the custom admin and you it's relay Ships and why it is like that ok so Basically looping through those items is this these two strings has all we need and then When I could grab a listview let's see We are busy working on adding the Bootstrap library to JCB At the moment with basically God UI kit version 2 Linked to JCB And I've dealt selected the list I option for this you like it Uikit is a library developed by yootheme If you do not know you like it I would encourage you to actually go Google that And Then your You'll see it's quite a nice library to use we have voted the Bootstrap is the better one And so we are migrating to Bootstrap But will still support you like it as much as we can so for now just to get things going We simply gonna loop over the items show the name nothing is here Clickable writing as editable is just to get you know you introduced to using Views 7 cloves Now we gonna go back to our component And we are gonna at the site for you to it You might ask why don't we just Add the side of the component to the side view when we create the same for you And that was a idea that You know I did play with but because of database relationships and all kinds of Reasons I felt that the better approach would be to linkside views At admin At the component area instead of at the site area This gives us the option to use side views quite easily with in other components That was really the idea behind it We might resync this and we might we shall fill this in the future I mean this is the first time I bow Such a component called JCB and who knows what happens if we start refactoring it and more Advancement program is get involved it might be come even here for better than it is now Now but this is how it works at the moment So you go to side views And you click create link site views And then you basically select that breeding site view you say yes I want to have an admin menu sorry be able to add a menu to the front of my website with this year View I want this beauty is metadata this is going to be this components therefore View I wanted to control access will look at That again but I want that access to that it's default be public so this is Basically begin making use of all the options and save and close So now if we go back to compiling our component There's no changes being done to the database I need to maybe just give you a heads up here if you're Adding new tables DBS Bill to Ashley know that and add the tables to a Sequel update which when you update the book component it automatically updates today the base But it's still important for you to actually check that it does this For there could be a reason that it thinks that it's not necessary Yet I tried to Most Yeah I've tried to build enough places things in place so that all actually pick up that you've had it I Every field or a new View to the component and that the component now needs to increment a version And Release a table update but sometimes that is not happening and And then even if you update your component the database is not being updated Necessarily So that's just something you need to keep your finger on make sure that that happens The most bite JCB will take care of that Answers now and this upgrade we have only added a front and we haven't touched the data Everything about that is just the way it was before so we can without any concerns just compare And Re-install the component And then go and add it To the front So we can sort a look at what has happened Ok Now just a heads up When you add a front and side view and you said that it's default should be public But it's not the first time you installing the component then that default cannot be set to the database because Default that only gets said the first time the component gets installed I don't wanna go into all All the technical reasons for that but you could go into the app the components script file and you can search through it To see what I mean because it's actually a function that gets added to the script file and only get simpler Ended with on the first installation of the component now that's important then if you do not Even follow what I was saying now and why I said it then I hope you'll get to To understand it as I try and demonstrate these things Before you can add the greetings to a site admin sorry to a site menu let's It's just at least add a few breedings Ok So we've got at least 4 greetings in place and now we can actually add That list View to an Front and side view So we go to menus And Go to main menu Select menu type click hello world readings I was the previous component Ok Everything else looks good So we've got greeting set as the home Of this website And we gonna click save and close There we go But got home and other world greetings That should mean that if we click on This Preview The front end of the site We should see the greetings It's gotta say the page isn't redirecting properly And the reason is like I explained We set the front side view That it should have access control Which means You can control who sees this page not that it's just open to everyone but But you can say only this group can see it all only that group can see it But since we haven't set that And by Default Doesn't allow anyone Now we said that it's by Default should be public but like I explained But I Gave you that heads Up It only sets that D for the first time the component is installed so it is the way you should ship the Component If you only add that feature later You need to do custom scripting in the script area Which is the beyond hello world component tutorial To update a database and ensure that this view is actually public The manual way to do this is basically to go to the whole world component Click on options Then go to permissions Scroll down To the area where you see greetings site access Select the public group And change The site access To allow This will now ensure that the site area is actually Available To the public So having true fresh the Public area when Elsie James Williams Sarah and Chris All of them loading As expected Ok now Let's Add a Link to James so that when you click it you actually see the greeting that James should receive So we go back to the site views and we open the greetings Now we wanna add a link here But there is a better way of doing a link in JCB Which really takes care of all the Controller issues When I go to the front end of the component in the open The model for greetings Will see that there is the get items method And in it we are basically checking Whether this item has an alias If it does have an alias ADD and ID It actually creates what is known as a slug And this Elias And it gets combined Into The Slug Since we know that our greetings area does not have an Elias In fact it only has an ID It will only end up with an ID in The Slug So Let's go add an alias 2 hour breeding There is a shortcut to the site Sorry the fields linked to an admin area it's this little icon here And we basically want to add another field called alias And if you go to the fields We'll see that there Is already a field called alias So we can simply use that field So go back back to the admin views And we'll click on this shortcut for Adding fields And We got a Basically Click here and add an alias We gonna tell the system that this isn't Addis And Now we are moving Both of these above the tabs And we are creating the earliest to be second in line And the greeting We are going to Let's see Make it a fool with The greeting We also gonna go editor greeting In a moment So that it's no longer text field button text area Ok so we got name alias all of that is in place saving close Going back to fields I'm going to open the greeting And since there are some Buddies I want to stay the same I am going to select That XML Definition And I'm going to copy it Then I'm gonna select Textarea Then I'm gonna paste That first XML in here We obviously have to remove it again But just so I can copy paste Cut the name I want to keep the same name You can't just change the type because the type up here Needs to actually correspond with the type here So just changing the type in there will not work So the label you want to keep that the same We want to add Etsy Hand greetings as a description We don't want to default text And it's at the hint back again Didn't really need any of these other Fields so we can just remove them We don't want the filter to be set to Raw Would rather use the word string We don't want any HTML at this stage in our grading If you want HTML nodig reading you can use The Safe HTML I see it's not in this list but it actually does exist Usually we would use the editor instead of just a text area Anyway So here we go We got Textarea replace And I'm gonna add just here Spun 12 an hour long that's gonna still be there is class But I think it is still there And now I think that should do it Yeah let's change this They know what we don't need to change that Save and close Ok since we didn't change any of the database values with this text field We shouldn't have any issues But we did add a new text field So if we go to the comp I Compiler And we compile the components You see that a dynamically incremented the version and If we go without installing we go to the component you see that it hasn't Actually updated view because this was open so before doing anything I would Suggest reopening the view basically refresh the page So that the changes we also basically show So now we can go back in simply install the new changes And if we go to a Hollywood we should be able to Open the other world and we should see the earliest there and if we click save It should dynamically add a new L as now we'll have to To do this for every item because the Elias is are saved or created only want to save the Item so I'm just opening all of them quickly now usually a user using your compound You only gonna ship this component when you've got everything in place I hope and so they wouldn't You have to do all this gymnastics to make sure that all the values are in place and if by some reason They have to you will have to help them along with some custom scripting I suppose Anyway So now that we got all our items set And it actually has an Elias We can start working on those links There's one more place we need to make a change And that is in the dynamic yet If you remember when we set it up We didn't actually Include The Elias So I'm gonna copy this I didn't just change to just another View quickly and then back to this one So that we can get the earliest there 4 years the Elias that we want We don't need all these And we can just add that over there There we go we got the earliest now also selected Save and close So We can check with this alias is actually being Brought to the page Bye Adding a little I call it Hub reduction tricks So Would you do it or PHP dump here Bar Dump And We just take all the items Copy Pasted in there Hand safe Now we go back to the compiler I'm just quickly compile this again And Install Go to the homepage Refresh And now you see that it dumps all the values on the page and then this place them So now we can look and see ok well fine Where's the ugliest and actually created that Slug we spoke about So we got the slide for every item and that is the first step in setting up Hey Well-formed Link 4 Opening one of these items I don't know what Some of you might think Wow that's got a lot of things to do to get this to work But I can tell you if you wanna build components for dress for 2 Muller And wanna go outside of the box Both things that are actually unique and completely different from what other People are doing And this is really just the basics Ok so we gonna Set up a trap year Around This name But we are gonna use PHP to basically take care of creating a link for us So here we are simply gonna say Echo And I'm gonna go show you where we get the name The class name for what we wanna do here I guess you're back in the code You see that there is In the helper class A File called router so you can open that And you'll see that you have what his know now called hello world help her out And If you scroll down We don't have this stage have how yes we haven't added the the side view for the single record So there are some values missing your man I should have first done that Anyway I'll go do that now but we'll come back to this file And there is another file Or I should say class It works together with this class And it's basically these two classes with their methods That we were gonna use to actually build our link Ok so let's Create That display side view So I removed the The Vaal Dam from this view I'm just gonna save and close this I could have said saving you Just gonna create Another site View And we gonna call this Greet We can't call it greeting because like we said There is already a greeting in the front All greeted at might be better We gonna Make a nice display here I'm using Panel I'm gonna copy the panel slip it Pasted in here And the title I'm gonna make The name And the content Will obviously be the greeting No I don't want to a rose Some good takeout this one So I basically Got one breeding setup here It's not yet gonna be off here there's no buttons here yet to edit it But he will basically view One Greeting And it will also show you who set up the greeting And ok now we can close this So we got this greeted Side view We can help go to the admin area Of the Good because sorry to Joomla component area And I'm gonna click on here And Actually add a side view To the component Same way we did before Can I say I want greet I don't want it to have an admin you It must have 2 metre It's not a default view I also want access there And by Default it's not public So Save and close Now we'll compile the component again Ok I've compiled installed it If we now go back to the Far right just Opened previously this hello world Helper route And we scroll down Will see that now has a method called greet route And you basically pass it and ID And it constructs The The URL for you Now This component view doesn't have category So it will skip this area But it's A function that I Wrote that shoot Be able to Basically Work for any View So You want to use this Method And this abstract class Now Those of you that are Lil Bit interested in how this works You'll see in the main File of the site View You'll see that the router Is actually also added as a helper class And This is basically the name of this helper class hello world Help her out And so That's the abstract class name Going back to our site view of greetings To add a link We now know The method name So that's the method name And that's abstract class Sorry that's the class name now let's get the method name I go back to Scroll down That's the method name so we can Just copy it Ravenously Needs to Bukhara spawning to the view we want to open And we wanna give it The Slug so it's gonna be a term Slug But that's not the only function That we want to call here there is another one I mentioned Which works alongside this and it's called the jail route Function Actually class I should say So we would add to jail route around this First A method class And That would basically At the Other values to the euro That is required Ok so we've got our own helper class of a component We are at we give at The Slug Which then gives it to the J router Which then Echos out The link To open this item Great Now let's save this and compile again To see it in action We go to the front and Reload the page And when we click on one of these says not authorised To view greet That means This specific group Are not allowed to look at this What are ways to prevent the link from showing up in the first place But this is if for some reason you didn't actually put that custom script Place You see You can actually see how the backend generates some of this So if I go into the code And we go to the admin area Of The Hello world component And we open the model And we opened readings No no no it sorry not the model Actually the view and then readings And we open the body And we open the view data HTML You'll see that it is grabbing Some permissions to know whether it should show certain buttons And then here Is again setting up some permissions To see whether You are allowed Two actually Edit Here it is To actually edited the The greeting And if you're not allowed to edit it It just Echoes the name You see it doesn't show you the link So this area here Is really a demonstration of what you wanna do in the front You don't wanna always show the link To the item unless The person Who is action viewing the site Is in the correct group Of the site To be able to actually View The item No I'm not gonna spend more time on this Part because we wanna also do an editing concept Which is really More interesting and what I would rather spend time on So here I'm just gonna go back into the admin View In the admin area And just change the permissions that the actual public could still open this view for now So in the backend I go to options of the Barloworld component Permissions Scroll down Again I'll see there is a new one called greet Change this to allowed for the public group And save and close out of there Now I forgot back to the front And click on This link It actually opens it And it gives us the name James gives us the welcome welcome to JCB And the greetings were said by the Superuser K so it actually loads it as we expected You can also see in the Euro this demo side of mine isn't fully Search engine friendly setup But it already generates that this is a greet To James And soap And the name James appears here because of the Slug The Slug is used to generate the search engine optimisation here If we didn't have an Elias it would have given you one or two Depending on the item ID Ok so That just gives you a quick demonstration Of how to set up A front-end That actually can open specific items Now The Next Step Is there actually make these items editable I like I explain to you In the admin area we're ready doing some of this So I'm gonna just basically copy and paste most of the code From the admin area And I would encourage you to do the same Unless you know enough that you can just do it without looking at how JCB did it So I'm gonna copy The string And then I'm going to also Copy this one These few lines And then I'm also gonna use some of these I realise by looking at this first area that the Checkout And This Checkout value Needs to be said on the page I also need to make sure about this value Because We need to check the users for Roti On the page so we need to check whether the user is set On the page So We can go and do that and look at some code I'm gonna move some of this code And then we'll go to the front end of the code area I want to add the option to edit the item In both the list as well as the Single View So I'm gonna do it in the list your first and that I'll demonstrate step-by-step And then when we go to the Single View I'm just gonna place the code in place Am I not gonna explain to much because it's basically the same So here in the side view Of the list area I'm going to PHP and I'm going to Custom view script It says add PHP script to the head of the file So I'm gonna paste This link in here and we see that it basically Has this view Greetings And the task is greeting Edit So that is the task And it's gonna be available in the edit Variable Ok so that's the first part of the code we want up on the page Now for the rest of it We go back to the APT Monday again The backend And we see with it we need to grab These as well So Before grabbing them Let's open the price bonding side view so we can look at some of the code Ok so Here is the greetings I'm gonna open this view HTML And we'll see that the user is already being loaded onto the page so we've really got the user That's great This is the items Ok let's look at this How is good for you to actually go and look at the code The JCB is writing seeing the code Is what makes you familiar with how things work And also helps you to detect when something doesn't work Why And how to fix it Since we know that the user is on the page and we go to the site B admin area This area We see that it's accessing the user in the same way Using this As an object User And ask him where that has authority On the core Marriage To check in And then also it Basically takes And gets the check out user Details And We'll see why in a moment But we don't have the check out user on the page So What we gonna do this week gonna quickly Also get those values by going to the dinner may get And making sure that those values get brought to the page as well So we go to list greetings And again like before we just copy all those values And just tweak away and then back And the values we now want to make sure also comes along Is basically I see it's a value that it doesn't by itself add To the selection But you can add it in because you know it is in the database It's just that This table selection Only shows at this stage the actual values that That it knows belongs to the view I think I need to update this in JCB It is a little tweak which I haven't done So it's not showing the Checkout and Checkout by values But you can type it in by just going And then Those values will also be brought to the front Officeserv you So Basically the Checkout and The check out time Actually don't need to check out time I need to check out Basically who checked it out We could have the time But I'm not gonna demonstrate that during this tutorial we'll really it was over an hour and so few minutes So I'm just gonna use to take out for now saving clothes So we've updated our Dynamic get And that means our values are on the page and we can move our code into place We need to add it inside of this for each loop Since this code Is actually working with the item Itself Ok so we've got the code in there Recalling the user We also checking the item check out to the user ID Making sure it's 0 We checking whether to check out user Now let's go get the rest of the code we need Begin in the admin view we gonna go with This area here And just copy that I wanna make a few adaptations because in the end of the day The front end is a little different from the back end In that It is only Back and only displays an edit view the front-end also displays a review So We wanna make it a little different You can pause the video to see some of the things I've done here But in simple terms I basically got the edit here I'm editing echoing the edit Link And I'm adding the item and I'm putting in a little icon which then you can click And here I'm checking whether you have permission To actually edit This item so if we were save this and refresh the homepage It should actually not change anything because the public doesn't have permission to edit it at this stage Ok that I can't should be pencil not edit Ok so let's save this and compile it 2 to see it in action Install it And we reload the home page Rose you can see it doesn't show those little Buttons Now if we go to the back end And we go to options And we change That The public is allowed to edit And Let's say it now change state Yeah Let's just do that trailer allowed to edit And It's open the front again When I see that it shows the edit Pencil Let's click on that And we see it opens The edit area Word can actually now Add the exclamation And click on save Save and close It tells us that the message was saved excessively If we now Open that greeting We see that has the exclamation 2 hour A time to integrate Or to make out items editable On the front end Within the control of permission groups Has actually worked very effectively if we again Revoke the permissions And Refresh the page Insult me those links are gone And even if somebody Were to try and Circumvent the system By having In the Ural paste in the link To edit that specific item and It will actually Say that it's not permitted So the The the permission of structure is actually Armed and will protect the item from being edited by By that group So Again we gave the Public Permission to edit But now the question is Can we also give it permission to create So going back to greetings Let's add an option to create An item Why did this button here With Airlink To create an item But I'm not adding any chicks around it But you basically need to same kind of Check as you've using here Except that there are some Shortcut let me Let me show you So basically around the button we added this PHP That takes the uses a faulty to create For the core Office component If yes Then it will show the button if no the button will not show So that is to control the visibility of the button So let's save this and then compile and install To see it in action So we see the button doesn't show And that is because currently Who got a component set That Republic Cannot Actually create If we allow creating For the public And we Refresh the page You see that now it actually shows Sorry that's the different view Ss1 Refresh this page There we go Heifer click on it It will open an area where we can create an item So here we can sit in your name And then Save and close We get this safe not permitted This must mean that we haven't granted enough permissions For the Public user Taxi create an item See giving it the option to create an item Is not enough because there are fields That You know you need also access to Before you can create an item So let's let's try again But first giving it more permissions So if granted it Basically all the permissions That it needs Go to the front Now we click create greeting Save and close And there we go With saved the item We can again edit the item We can close And we can View As you can see it's all working As expected So Our hello world tutorial Is nearly at it's end We have within this tutorial demonstrated to you How to create A hello world component List It items Open individual items And editors items As well as creating new items All based On the permission of structures Of the component So if we Where to change these permissions back To not allowed And we now refresh the front We'll see that Now we can only view the items And even more Every go back And we wanna control the actual viewing of the great items Not to be visible to the public but maybe only two let's say managers we could do that So you can manage That kind of control over your items You know without actually A lot of Crust in code If you click on it now it will tell you don't have authority to view it That you can add Basically custom Scripting To remove the link so that it doesn't even look clickable If the person doesn't have access to view it But that's ready We gone so far over the time Trying to demonstrate to you Some of the basic principles of setting up and how low component In JCB I trust you if Android this tutorial Wi-Fi doesn't reusing it take this long to actually build a k Hollywood component In fact there is a older tutorial Where we managed to build a Hollywood component in a very Shorter time Illustrated and then must read in and explain it all more here To help you guys along To actually build components with JCB And that you'd realise that JCB Is really actually a very powerful application I mean I haven't even gone to the code this time And shown you all that it's written But I mean just from the compiler We ready got 13000 lines of code Which would have taken you 58 our days to write Which is about At 39 hours And I think for a basic component that's quite a lot of code And it's because that it's already integrating a lot of promotional structures and How you know version control I mean if I was to Open The greetings And Just open James When are we added that No Exclamation mark We could check the version We can see the changes and when it was made We can actually review Some of the previous versions And we can even go back to those versions That kind of integration With your history component is done automatically by just adding history And so is many of the other features The JCB is adding to your component like export of data import of data Bosch Pearly Beach Changes that you can make As well as You know whole lot of other concepts Which It's just Beyond the scope of what we had time for today Well enjoy coding and yes If you have any issues Please go to get up First take out the Wiki page Check the tutorials And if you just think you've discovered a bug You're most welcome to open an issue And we'll see what we can do in trying to resolve that for you We would like to invite other PHP Programmers To really get involved on the JCB Get up Community And help us improve JCB So that It can become a home Parys to manage The troubled waters of open-source Development Thank you
