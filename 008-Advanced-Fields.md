# ADVANCED FIELDS

There are a few advanced field types. The most advanced is one called custom field type. Sorting by custom fields, you will see that we have quite a few custom fields in place. [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m32s)

**Setting Up A Folder**

Let us look at two of these. One is the local file list, the other one is 'sermon'. We'll look at the local first. You will see that the whole 'XML field definition' column is PHP. I'm creating a view that is taking information from the global settings of your component so that there need to be a field with a name 'localfolder' in your global settings. When we get to component we'll look at setting up global settings. If it doesn't have a setting it falls back onto the image which is in the 'JPATH ROOT'. For your component this will be replaced with your component name. It places it into local folder. [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m36s)

Now I start the options array, which you are going to return. Select 'Please add files'. If there aren't files it will say 'Please add files' too, and give the local folder name. If there are files, we are going to update them at 'JFolder'. First we bring in the file system classes from Joomla, then we check whether that folder exists. If it doesn't exist we create it in the field type. Once it's created and it exists, it doesn't go in there; it grabs all the files from the folder and place it into files and starts up an array where it loops the files and places it into options. [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m40s) By doing that we are adding the file names to our options array. Returning the options array. You can add your own custom PHP scripting when you extend a list field. We are extending a list field. It is going to be a drop down list of all the files in that specific folder; either images or the folder that was set globally in local folder. 

There is a field type called 'file list'. I didn't use file list because file list has a static directory to where you need to add the files to view them. [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m44s) We want it to rename the folder for the files, for the media, etc. then have it update itself automatically. So we created a custom field where we extended the list type. We chose a custom field, and then extended the list type. (We don't want it to add 'new button' because it won't work.) We are allowing them to select multiple. Since we are using multiple, we need to make sure that we are storing it as a 'JSON'. That is when you have 'multiple' or 'arrays', or any kind of arrays in a value that needs to be stored as a 'JSON'. [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m48s) The component builder itself will check if the multiple selection is true and automatically store it in a 'JSON' object even if you forgot to select 'JSON'.

**How to Create a Sermon Preacher Custom Field**

It is a preacher custom field. It will show a list of preachers, but will display the preachers that are set up in the preacher list view. Open that 'Sermon Preacher.' [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m52s) The convention is that you should call the type, preachers, that is the list view name. You should use the same as the editing name which is preacher without the 's'. If you go back to your admin views you would use this name as the name of the field, but you have to use that name as the type because you are now creating a custom type. The logic behind it is that while it shows a list of preachers, you might have selected just one preacher.

You can use any label you like, whatever is descriptive enough for your user to understand. There is a place for adding a description. In 'XLM field definition' we set multiple to false. They should be able to only select one preacher at a time. At 'Default 0' all are left to their default values. [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m56s)

**Jform in Component Builder**

'Extending list' is the most common custom field that we have. If you want to receive a list of custom fields that is available, you can go up here to 'extend' and see the list, radio, and check boxes that are available. User is also a user option to extend users. If you want to see what is available, look at that name 'Jformfield' and go to component builder. Go to the back end of component builder. (See video.) Go to compiler, then to Joomla 3, which is the current version we are targeting. Search for that Jform. [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m00s) Those available to extend are  user, Jform field, JForm field user, Jform field radio, Jform field list, and Jform field checkboxes. This means that if there is a form field you want to extend that doesn't exist in our advanced seminar, you will be shown how to add your own form fields here. There would be two places you need to change. One of them would be adding the field and update it accordingl; the other one would be adding it in the code at some places and in a Json file called settings there. These are some of the things we will deal with in the advanced adaptation of component builder. [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m04s)

**Extending List in Custom Field**

Getting back to extending a list field: you simply add list. There are a few conventions. One of them is that if you are going to be targeting 'Preachers' for example, you will be using the preacher table as the table being targeted. The question to ask is where the data going to be found. This table needs to be added. (See video.) The reason why we have this 'component' here is because it's a placeholder which component builder will replace with the component's code name once it's built. [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m08s) We added this feature because sometimes we want to rename components. If you had statically added the actual component name there, you have to update that name in every field and view.

To explain what the system is doing, go to components, open 'Sermon Distributor,' take the name in code, like that 'sermondistributor', copy, and you'll see that it is a lowercase 'c.' If it had been an uppercase l it would mean that you'd have to place the component's name with an uppercase as well. [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m12s) The system is replacing these place holders with the actual component name on the fly. Using the placeholders saves you time in the long run from making changes everywhere if you make a change to a component's name. Which is quite normal to do. Often you start with the component and think of calling it something and later realize that the name is been used in the Joomla repository, and you need to choose another name. To do that is going to affect the whole component, so we added this placeholder structure which should make the data easier.

In all the custom coding that you're adding where you need to use the components name, you can use the tag format of replacement. [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m16s) In some areas you would need to use brackets. Most of the time it works either way. The best way to ensure that it works is to try it with a hashtag first; if it didn't replace it in the code, the angle brackets need to be used. In this case we are using these ### characters. Again, the view is the single variable of the view. If we close and go to the view which would be preacher, all lowercase is what you would be adding here. Make sure that it's always lowercase. [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m20s)

The list view (or the views plural) would be the add value there. All lowercase too. The value field is the field that the user will see. It is visible in the UI user interface. The key field is the value that will be stored in the database. This field relate to this table (#-###component###-preacher). Inside this table, which field do you want the user to see? The name of the preacher. Inside this table, which field would you want to store in the other database? We are going to store it wherever the field is being used. That would be the ID and the column name in that data base of that view where this field will be used. [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m24s) It will be called preacher. To show that in the database itself. Open it. (See video.) Go to sermons, click 'new,' and you will see a place for preacher. If you were to look with firebug at it, you'd see that it is the name is preacher. (Remember we spoke about this Jform_ as the ID.) It's simply the preacher field which is being stored directly in the database in the preacher column of the table. [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m28s) It's stored as INT 11 and we say that it is a key. We can target it. If we look at indexes, we'll see that it had added it as a key.

**Custom PHP layout in Field Definition**

All of that is done in the database structure and in this area. (See video.) Here you can add your own custom PHP. I'm using 19, 18, 17, etc so that it's creating line breaks and spacing and tabs for me dynamically. I could have placed them all under PHP one, without these quotation marks. [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m32s) We wrap around them like we did with the file folder list view example we did previously.

(Just a note: inside of this code, you can't use quotation marks; you need to use single quotes, even if you try to do an escape. It will not behave as you might expect.)

**Build Code for Sermon Preacher**

These place holders reflect back to these 'key_field_id' values. (See video.) Basically, 'a.###ID###' will be written here and the text value which is the field value is going to be called 'a.###name###' and then '###ID###' and '###code_text###'. [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m36s) This code is built up by the view that we are in, as well as by the text, so it would read sermon preacher in the code.

* **Example (See Video)**

To show you how it looks when it is being built. Open jformfieldlist. That is what it starts with, replacing this place holder with your code. It replaces all these features up here as well. [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m30s) Everywhere you see '###component###', it will be updated through component builder. Everything here will be replaced with your licensing tags. Let's look at the finished product. Sermon is placed on the module field and there is 'preachers'. [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m57s) If you open it you'd see that it added preacher there, and the input added. If you trip that switch, like we have explained, to show the line numbers in your component. It shows you in what file. [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m15s) These files are found if you go to component builder, helpers compiler. These are the files that are being used to compile your component.

**Generate a New Button**

We are trying to build a component, not as yet to extend component builder itself. [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m40s) Here you can see where in the code it is building, compiling, and putting this together. [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m59s) This is used for the button. (See video.) This is to generate a new button. When you click on new, this is the button. This area is generating the button. This controls whether the button should show up or not. [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m21s) If it is to be set at all, this is what generates the button. We said that the 'get options' will show the name and 'ID'. Going back to our structure here, we dynamically replace these (###ID###,###name###) with 'view preachers'. The reason for this is that it's done a few times. [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m48s) We'll say that you only need to update these values and it would get updated all over in the bottom of the code. It makes it easier to change your custom fields. A field called preacher name was built. Which again used 'preacher_name' as an object value. [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m17s) Because it  retrieves the object from the database and it seems as if the object exists, it reiterates and builds up option list which is returned to use in the drop down. It dynamically generates your list. So component builder through this infrastructure compiles all of the code for you and puts it in the right file in the right place.[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h21m37s)

Once you have built a component and know where you have made those changes in component builder you can look at the files if you know how to build a Joomla website. I used the same conventions as decor in regards to implementation of the files. [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m07s)




**Dropbox Custom List Example**

We can quickly look at Dropbox manual file list. [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h22m36s) This one is much more advanced. What we are dealing with here is a file that is stored. What I did is I created a function in my component global helper function called 'getDropboxlinks'. It tells you it [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m02s) wants manual links and it passes a specific variable '2'. And it would return a bunch of links and those links, will check if it exists. It will check the array, not only that it is an array but that it has values in it. And if it does, it actually just backs it into the options [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m24s) And gives it over to the options array, to the list. 

**Component Helper Class**

This part here means that you can add a helper static method call in your custom field types, [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h23m44s) this two symbols(::) mean that it is a static method being called from a class. Now this class is something that if you know the Joomla API and know how to work with builder component, you will know that you can add to any component what is known as a component helper class. [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m07s) If I was to go to sermon distributor, the component helper class is always located in the helper folder of the admin as well as the site view. The admin is then in the back end in which is administrative components. [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m28s) There(See video) is the component and there is its helper folder. In the front end you have the same convention, component, sermon distributer, and there is the helper structure. Here(See video) is some of the [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h24m49s) script of sermon distributor structures through its helper structure. There(See video) is the helper file for the front. Here(See video) is helper file for the back.

Now to add methods [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m09s) to the helper files. If you want to know what all the custom helpers is that we ship with all components, you can open component builder. You can go to the compiler and to Joomla 3 and then look for the helper file in the site helper file. [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m30s) If you open it you will see a whole lot of helper methods. Obviously with a lot of place holders which we will customized for each component that it targets that component. You would see there is a Json to string method here just to 'getvars'. There's a 'getvar' singular. This is just to get one variable from the database so you don't need to to rewrite [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h25m55s) this whole string to get just one variable. You can come and look at how this works and use this to get a variable from the database. We also have 'ispublished' to check if a specific object is published. [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m14s) This is way beyond the scope of just looking at custom fields. We will go into great depth into all the features of a helper structures when we deal with advanced concepts. This is just a heads up so that you can start looking at it and possibly get yourself going. I wrote these functions, checkobject, checkarray, checkstring, [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m40s) checkJson, shorten, mergearrays, savestring, and HTMLescape, replacenumbers, this one I'm using quite often. If you do savestring [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h26m58s) we change every number in the string immediately to text, so that you can be sure whatever you get back from savestring doesn't have numbers in it. This is quite necessary especially if you don't know if the first character might be a number. [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m20s) In this way we are insuring that it is always text.




<Editted








**Strings**

There is a whole bunch of custom methods that we ship with all components that are developed. So if you were to open like I have said, sermon distributors, [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h27m40s) helper class, you will see that these helper classes are all showing up here. Getactions, shortenstring, mergearray. So you can come and any of you feel that the methods that I have used here is archaic or outdated, [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m00s) please go on the forums at Github and talk with me about it. I will gladly look at it and see. I know I recently tried to improve on this checkstring by doing that(adding {}). So I could actually dump this part(&& strlen($string)>) and save on [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m22s) the query. But for some strange reason this started causing problems all over and strings that were strings were being returned as not being strings. But what I can tell you is that I  [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h28m41s) went back to the old school way of doing it. Which is this way(taking out the {}). I don't know there might be an easier way. Obviously we first want to ensure that it's set. That this value is set. And then it is a string and then it actually has a length you see something can be a string and yet don't have a length. [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m04s) I might be wrong on that and yet this is what I found. I've only been coding and PhP for 3 years now. You can teach me a few things. You have been at it longer than I am. 

Back to the UI. That is where I get these values. Showing it to you in here, go up a bit [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m29s) where it says getDropboxlinks. We see that it has this thing of return which is set to false. That means if I only was to say, that it should return the manual values. Then it will only return the value manual links. But since I've set it [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h29m52s) to 2, it will return all of those links and not just one of them. Because you can target that it returns one specific sermons link. This method is quite dynamic. That is all that I'm calling in this advanced [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m15s) field type which is called custom field. And it gives me an array of all the links which I just load like I have explained. That is again as you can see quite advanced implementation of this custom fields. [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h30m37s) I hope you would realize, there you can do anything. With that list conception you could even grab a bunch of website names from somewhere. You can put any PHP in there and build a list which can be used to save to the database. That would be the custom fields. 

**Custom User**

There's also one called custom user. The custom user at the moment doesn't look like I have any [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m08s) in the demo data for you. I just click on new and then select custom user. You'd see that the custom user basically, you don't need to set or change anything from [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m25s) here to there. All those should actually just work. The only part that you want to consider removing, would be the PHP, This part here(see video). Basically what this part does, it limits the user list [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h31m47s) to only a certain group. That means again you need to set up a global value in your component field. In our Global, remember we talked about that previously. The options button, if you click on options, [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m07s) it opens a place which you set global. These are all global values. This is a area for global values. You can get hold of those global values through the component helper, getparams with a component name. And get when there(###text###) you would place the field name. [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m28s) That's how you can get a value from your global settings. And basically I'm getting a specific groups value and placing it in here(groups). And then I am returning that group. That is all this part(see video) is doing. Those two sections are actually independent. So this one is what helps you set. [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h32m52s) I want to return a specific group. This part helps you set any users you want to exclude. This specific feature here, ensures that only one record per user is set. Let's say a user has already been added to a previous record, then that user should not show up again. [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m18s) It should be removed from the list. This is what this PHP is doing. It's simply looking to this current view and checking if there is users and getting their ID's. And then setting them up in the correct manner. They are unique and then returns them. [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m36s) Those are the users that already have. If you are building something which are supposed to have student details, for example, you don't want a student to have more than one entry in that table, you want every student to just have one in. [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifHTMLqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h33m58s) And so if a student already is selected, you wouldn't want them to be selected again, that's what this exclude feature does. 

Now to show that to you in the code. Let's go to another project that I am working on called learning manager and models. And they have a field called studentusers and studentuser. [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h34m27s) There are two kinds of ways to do this. One is to not allow more than one user to have an entry. And the one is saying exclude users that already have been used. So that means if a user have been selected that whole thing that I've just explained. [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h34m52s) The other one returns null. Which means it will always show all users. And the way to have it set this to null would be simply to remove that part(selected on video) of the code. Then it will automatically set this(return null) value to null, component builder will do that. When I gets about the group part it's the same principle. [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h35m19s) If you don't want it to just show a specific group, you can actually set it to null. Like that(return null) and component builder will do that. All you need to do is simply remove what is part of the code. And it will actually do that. And that is to target a specific group. [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h35m48s) And also to target or to remove specific users. Let's say that you want to remove users that belongs to other table or other structure, then all that PHP that you need to write, you can place it on the type_phpx. [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m11s) So you could do that type_phpx1=. All your PHP can be placed in here for excluding. And for the group, it's simply, not directly one, it must have an underscore(_). [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m33s) You can just take that one. And this one will be used for the groups. It says it there Getexcluded method. PHP for the getgroup method. And in the code which is stored under fields, models. You will see what it will do. You can do things and then come and look [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h36m59s) what did component builder build. How does it look then. You can go to the view like we have here. And see does it's actually work? Is the preachers showing up? And then you can use firebug like that, and you can look, that one is [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h37m24s) of the index. You will use that(preacher). Here is a select list. And here you have the values. So that's the IDs and that is the actual name of the speaker. The ID and the name. That is how it should display the data.  Component Builder sets up the XML structure that Joomla uses [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h37m53s) to build this. Joomla is building this whole structure for you. So even this nice button and everything is Joomla's handiwork. It is doing that for you and this is all done through these XML [00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m08s) input values that you are adding here. So you would change the type to, you might say, staff members. 

There is something to remember here. The type names may not have underscores or any spaces in them. Anything that is not translatable usually needs to be [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m35s) not have any spaces. So you can't do this(add spaces). It will not work. So you must remove the underscore. You can do that(Uppercase M) but that will be made lowercase anyway. [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h38m57s) So you could just do that(lowercase m) instead. It will work because that is used not only in the file database but it's also used in the name convention and everywhere this file type is. So as you can see in here(code) that file type is called studentusers. And even the file is called that(studentusers). [00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h39m21s) And here it is called studentuser, and here it is called studentuser. And this one(jformfieldstudentusers) is with the s. That one(studentusers) with a s. In the file is also with a s. So you can see that specific type name is used everywhere. And you cannot have underscores in this class name. Neither in this type name. [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h39m46s) Maybe you can but so far my experience is that it doesn't work if you do have it. For some reason it doesn't work. That's just a heads up on naming of this type. So you can update these fields. They are mostly fields that are [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h40m07s) related to all the other fields. But this one specifically says extends user. It shows you how it's going to extend it. So if you removed all the PHP then this field as it is now, will show all users everytime. Let me just [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h40m28s) close out here. That is looking at the advanced field type called custom user.

**Repeatable Custom Fields**

Another one we need to look at is the repeatable fields. Repeatable fields is actually not that difficult but you need to understand how it's structured. You need to first create the fields that you want to repeat inside of repeatable fields. The way repeatable field structure looks [00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h40m55s) in Joomla, I mean when we look at it in the actual application. Let me see where did I used a repeatable field. OK here we have one. So this from there all the way to there(see video) is one repeatable field. And if you know a little XML and you worked with repeatable fields, you'll see that [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h41m23s) here is the the fields that are being repeated inside of the repeatable field. Repeatable field is a field type that has other fields inside of it. Now you don't need to write any of this. The way you would structure a repeatable field is very simple. [00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h41m47s) You first create the fields that you want to repeat. And do realize you can't use repeatable fields in repeatable fields. But you can use custom advanced fields in repeatable fields. 

So if you look at that we have here again you see there is a field type called: 'cause and risks'. If you know Joomla you would know there is no such field type 'cause and risks'. So that means this is a custom field. If I were to go to fields, [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h42m16s) you will see there is a field called 'cause and risks'. And it gets it information from this database table. This is another component that I've done with component builder. And it is [00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h42m35s) displaying those data. Also making some model changes to the data. And adding some style to it. Nonbreaking space and stuff like that. That is just dealing with the cause and risks.  

So looking again at our repeatable field you're able to add an advance custom field inside of it. [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h43m00s) But what you need to add it, is let's open females for our example as you need to have the field ID and you need to order it according to the order you want to displayed in the line [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h43m17s) where you do repeatable fields. If we close here and then we go back to creating a new admin view and I click on fields, you will see that there is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, fields in one row. If I click next they all appear again, [00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h43m43s) and if I click next they all appear again. And that's what repeatable fields is about. Now this structure, these fields if we would look at it how did I develop this specific pop-up repeatable structure. I can show that to you. Here is a list of all the repeatable fields that I've already built. This three pages of 20. [00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h44m08s) If we were to click on add fields for views, open that, this is the repeatable field for adding fields for views. All you see here as I'm saying you could add 800 fields it way over kill. But ok. [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h44m37s) And we call him the button add. 

**Joomla Icons Info & link**

So if we go back to the view, see it says add. Then I'm adding an ID in a class to it. A description which if we were to hover over it here(fields) it has a little setup fields for this view which is the description. [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h44m59s) Same there(discription) see and the label is fields. So it says there fields. Then the icon is list. Now the icon is what is shown in the button. That is a list. All that custom Joomla icons [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h45m17s) can can be used. And to know these icons you should go to a URL Docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Joomla_Standard_Icomoon_ fonts. That is the URL and you'll get to this(Available Icomoon Icons) page. [00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h45m41s) These are all the available icons and you basically use that(contract-2 and checkmark-circle) parts. If I wanted to checkmark-circle, copy checkmark-circle and I would [00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h46m02s) change the icon to checkmark-circle. So that's how you change the icon and then these are simply the ID's of the fields I want inside of the repeatable field. If I was to [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h46m22s) show you where to get the ID, it simply would be close your repeatable field. And you'd see the ID is next to the fields there on the right. So you would create the fields that you want to use in the repeatable field. And you would get a list of those ID's jotted down somewhere in a notepad or something. Just add them in the [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h46m51s) order that you want them to be added. Then inside of your repeatable field you would simply paste it in the fields area with a comma separating them. And then component builder will dynamically construct this whole structure for you [00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m11s) and add it to your component. I think it's really stunning and I hope you enjoy using the repeatable fields structure. I know it's little buggy still and there's a lot of talk about it not being as stable. But your normal basic fields like text fields and radio buttons and so forth they all work well. The only thing about the radio buttons that you use in [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m39s) the repeatable fields you need to remove the class ff your radio button. It cannot be a button. It must be a dot unfortunately they don't yet make it possible to actually load the button. Now what's the difference? [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h47m59s) The difference is, let me see if I can quickly show you. That(Add CSS YES/NO) is the button version of a radio button. That(searcable Yes/No) is the dot version of the radio button. And it doesn't look like a button. [00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h48m20s) In your repeatable fields you cannot use the button version. It needs to be this one(searcable Yes/No). What makes it a button? It is the class that is being added to the field. So you need to remove the class values from your radio button if it's going to be used in the [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h48m38s) repeatable field. If you forgot to do that and you compile your component and now you are looking at the repeatable field you'll see that the radio button is not working, but that it messed up until they possibly fix it. This is unfortunately the case. That is looking at advanced fields [00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzYbifqv0M&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h49m04s) called custom fields, custom user fields, as well as repeatable fields. These are really the advanced field types that there are.
