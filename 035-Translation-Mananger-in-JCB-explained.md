Hi everyone We're getting have a great announcement to make JCB has again been expanded To now include a language translation Feature We are very grateful one of the contributors have Extended the code base for this We obviously Working together to Sure that it remains stable Those of you that been following The process on guitar pool Will know that As much time and effort Put into this So I would like to give you a quick explanation Of how this will work I love you that already using JCB Oh or a CB depends on We are asking acb advanced component builder JCB Gmail component Builder It is Actually work in English component And It builds the English Language file for you So every where in your fields When you create a field There there are areas in the in the field That says that it's translatable Translatable not translatable translatable And if you enter those values here JCB on the fly with take this description for example In all converted into a language placeholder An old added to the language file The English language file The British one Now This is all being done automatically For every area of the JCB Compiler Even in templates and views That's no front end If you create Uno side views And even templates and layouts You can Just adding These placeholders these straight text with the actual English language string in it Then the pasta with automatically crap that text and added to the language file So So currently JCB is building A a a complete English Language File for you And that means it's Already able to be Can I translate it But it has not have the feature for you to add Multiple other languages And so that is really but what is been the request The request is Isn't there a way we could Actually Translate This language strings And then when Jason be compiled to component it automatically add these other languages And so The The suggestion was That we basically Add an area where you can Create as many languages as you like Obviously in accordance with the conventions Your language tags Need to be in in accordance with the correct prefix is used in Joomla So I think we could add a link here Maybe on this page some point just to take you somewhere where you can find all the information to To use the correct Tagging For your language while And here you could obviously add the language name So you can create as many languages as you like Then When you compile a component JCB obviously life explained Grabs all the strings from everywhere And Adds into the British English translation file now let me show you some of that Happening in the code So here in the the gate Class We have a function called settling strings It basically you get it gets the content from wherever JCB is handing it And it passes it To see whether it has Either this language string or that one Then it does some gymnastics here to grab all the actual strings into an array A minute parts is this array Once it has it And it converts it Dual language string And it adds it back Into the content and returns the content and then With this matter We call it an object array It is adding the language string And the language key To the lung content array So that's a first thing we have this land can't enter a There's all over the place and it just gets Uno bulkier and bulkier Now the slang is basically the target It's the area Which this language strings belong to either the site Although Cite a system or the admin or the admin system area So there are four areas where the site this language string all there there is also such a thing as both While JCP compiles Some strings he knows must go to both And this is the actual language string be capitalised string Which is generated up here And This is then I trimmed and placed in in it Space Now Disarray Gets Placed into the files at a certain Point That point is very much at the very end of the compilation of course when everything is being sort of done Done We actually get to the place where We gonna now add two strings to the files So first we are basically Calling a function called said lung admin said lung system basically This is in the interpreter You can see these these methods are here said langside Euro said lung admin Basically adds a bunch of strings that are default always being added And then Also all the other strings have been built And then Move them over to a string called language And obviously the British English and it's for the admin area And so it does for all the various areas And did this Indian Fusion class it brings it together And then we grab the values of this strings We added to our value array And we basically Have the old multi language implementation running down From here from line Hundred 97 We start running into the multi language string implementation Now what does this do Basically It queries the database To see whether there is such a LAN English language string in the database And whether there is been any translations made for it So doesn't really use the place holders Because the place holders are so ambiguous between various components and our idea was To prevent a very bloated oversized database we must try to share strings amongst Components And so currently when you compile a component Gathers is English strings like I fix plane And then it shakes a database whether these English drinks already exist in the database And if they do then checks whether they have Translations already linked to them And if they do Then it starts grabbing that translation strings and adds them To this Language object array Also by tag and by area and then here we are basically passing this array so by this time Time we ready have all the languages In place and we are now able to put them into the component So It's basically these functions get multiple string A multi language strings Set langvlei soul disperse lung strings These are the functions That actually does the work So you could go look at these they are all found in the git Forget class at 1 we where everything really starts They are found there and you can look at them they are All their doings are are Obviously open source so you can see Now so that means by the point we get to this line 11 only We ready have all the language strings In their various Areas and various languages And we can now start adding them back into the component And that's really what this Partners doing It just adding it into the component So Now let's go back to the user interface to see this in action So I'm gonna come by the component Just any component Let's say this document manager And while I'm compiling it So keep in mind it will be running through And grabbing all the English strings then eventually will check This Language translation table Weather no strings Actually exist And if I do if they've been translated Ok so that's basically as simple as that It compiles it And It does most of the work for you Now the question has been asked What if You've changed some Fields name or some description And now That other description that Old English String Is no longer being used What what then Well at the moment It will basically be purged Now the purging works as follow When it Discovers that is string is no longer being used by a component We can go in the Kona I can show you that Then It basically asked the question Is another component still using it Ok Check if an if more components are using it Nf another component is using it It's simply who removes the current component from the string And then it it goes off it it doesn't Remove it If no other component is using it so let's say No all the component is any longer Linked to the string Then it checks whether there has been any work done in it Has there been translation done I mean it's quite a Huge job to do translation So we figured if you've done it you wouldn't want to just delete it So what we will do then As we basically archive The string We move it from the published State Do it archived State so you can go to archives and then there see all the strings that no longer Are actively linked to a component But has translations in it And if it does not have any translation So you've seen it's not link to a component And it does not have translation Then we remove the string from the database So these are the two functions to remove the string completely And so it's like it never it was there in the first place And so that is really how The Purge works at the moment it only purchase That would really is no longer link Neither has any work done in it And So That is what's happening at the moment Ok so now if we were to go to this component in JCB So the document manager You see there is a new tab called translation And in this tab it shows you all the English drinks Whether it's been having any work done in it so it will say no translation when the work has been done to it And in how many components it's been used So currently Most of these things as you see I used in quite a few other components And now you can from here Click on any of these strings And It will give you the list of all the components where it's used All show you the string you cannot edit the string here But you can add translations so yeah you'll select the language and you will add the translation And you can add as many as you like to the string And Then every one of these components this translation will be Active So That is really how The translation manager works There are two ways to get to the strings the one is like a show new wire the component And we are planning To add a button here Whereby you can import Vee's and export these drinks quite easily so that you could give them to other team members You can then make translations given back to you and you just import them here and that it gets linked automatically So that is still under development It should come out soon within the next Let me not give any promises Soon as we have the time And SO2 in you know to make it easier to do these translations The other way to get to these translations Is to Simply go to language translations And here you find all the components strings together So this could become a database With over 8000 lines I'm suppose But like you see it's working quite well I've already got a lot of components Mapped The ones that you see usually are there the ones that are active Which I'm working on I've got it quite a few in our favour is well So the reality is I'm I've been testing this against Periods So 89 components at the same time sharing strings among each other And I expect this feature to become quite powerful Soon as we are able to you know speed up the translation method There is been suggestions that we also Add this feature to a sort of a community area somewhere Where we you can push your English strings there and you can push a sorry Paul Already translated strings from it I know this is a great idea but how to manage that so that we don't fight people abusing the system Still under the bait So anyone have any good suggestions please go to get up open issue and let's start talking Well I hope this is enough explanation On how to do Multiple language implementation on your components in Joomla component Builder I'm quite happy about this new feature I really think it will In the long run Become a very valuable asset Anyway Thank you much Very much for watching Goodbye
