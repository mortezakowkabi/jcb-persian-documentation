I would like to demonstrate to you the new implementation Which isn't such a major thing but Something we've done to try and Help along some of the route to complexity So when you build a component And you have a front end For your component so you've got side views Your side views usually are getting it's data from a dynamic get Which you link up to the site View I just wanna make get basically returns her anyway Resultset As from this result set That we should get information By which we Combined with the view name Build what his called in Search engine friendly URL By your search engine friendly you always basically done with the router So JCB also built the router And a sort of guess is What should be these values So let me compile a component And show you what it guessed And then see how we women need to change it Ja component we working with here is so minister buter So I'm gonna compile it And I stole it to this website Your ass now the router doesn't really work I'm not gonna demonstrate Hot Dove actual front-end I'm just gonna show you the code And And let's take it from there So when you look at the website you've got your root directory admin And then components And then in here we've got some of those two And there's a file called router I'm gonna open this And you'll see there's got a function called build I'm a class method As well as a functional Pass I'm in this function Call Pass There is a switch Which basically Makes decisions based on the segments First value And if that segment value is Because usually that would be the view name In this forest Value Toyota termin switch Which view are we looking at is it preacher So we going through the list Now by Default without us You know making any changes JCB Builders for us All of it So If we look at preachers Which is a Basically a listview Let's open the preacher model So here is peaches We can scroll down And we'll see that In its Query It's basically get as a get items and here's got a list query And it really is just getting all the items from Database With no input from the URL whatsoever Let's see Yeah it doesn't do any of that and then it just Gives back So it's a simple as that It does not Need a euro value So that means it most probably will only Set this verse Value And all of this will really be that redundant it won't be used Because it's a listview So there isn't an alias We not looking at an individual item so there isn't an ID So we could Actually remove this year This code It's not doing anything Now It is also not gonna really Slow your site down that Dramatically it's fact it's it's hardly noticeable It's it's just that this is default Being generated Where us if we look at for example Preachers is there list view but then there is a view called preacher we see it here And it is saying that It needs to get the ID from Discernment able Which is actually in error So if I open the preacher And I look at the list query Then I see that in the list query about here It is getting an ID From the URL And it is asking that it should be equal to preacher So It is the main table is Is the Sermon table But it's not looking for the Sermon ID It is looking for the preacher Value in the Sermon table and that's why Jjc be fell back onto the table name And yet It should actually go to the preacher Table and See weather That future value is equal to this ID So it is actually Making an area Now you wrote the code or you set up the gate so you should understand the logic of what you see in the code here If you do not Then This is a feature with JCB has would you possibly won't be able to you know make use of Like we've said many times JCB is for those who know PHP And can actually write their own components Now I know that this is an error because we want to actually get the value the ID Of the preacher Is the one we need to check And it is is doing it wrong it should This value here should be preacher not sermon You can look at the Gateway are class you're at the bottom Yours to get bar cast And here you can see what it's going to do And how it's going to actually get the values So you can also use the get wow class Well you know for your own purpose So At this point we see at least one of the Router case Within the pass method In the case loop there's at least one A router area that needs to be changed I know by having looked at this before That there is actually more than one it's also this categories Down here This one Should also change This should also become Well actually it should just get a true Here FNB true because this is a category Look up Now the other place it also need to change is this one There should also be series So this is where the guessing which JCB doesn't Dynamically Did not match the complexity of our Dynamic get And I'm I'm sure that as time goes on we might Improve it's Guessing Ok we might get better ways of guessing correctly And Within the dynamics of the dynamic get Be able to actually build this case more effectively but Since we have not done that yet The quickest way for us to resolve this and which most probably be the most Dynamic option Is actually adding a way that you can replace the snippet of code Targeting the specific View So you'll never need to really know what is the view When you do this because they are placeholders And you need only remember where you at your dynamic Get So let me go and illustrate this within the JCP interface So all I wanted to show show you here is that we are actually targeting with this new Dynamic improvement age This little snippet This area here We not replacing the whole method Because really it is it is standard there's not much to do in Improving that and if we do it will be just improving it for everyone And the built function that really works well I haven't seen any issues with that So At the end of the day it seems like only the past method Needed a bit of an improvement So let's go back to the interface and let me let me show you Where we can make the changes To have the the category render correctly As well as the preacher This one here as well as the series where there's that one Parodies At what is this one Basically make the changes so that this will say Series And That this one will say true And this one This preacher would also say Preacher That's basically all we need to do and then this router Will work Without any errors Ok So here in the interface you have side views Now the side views the ones we wanted make changes to his this preacher The series and the category now I'm gonna show this to you little bit Long winded but Bear with me It's just make sure everybody say on the same page If you open preacher You would see that it has a dynamic Get called Sermons preacher ID and it say get list query Ok so This is the one We want to change They they get So that I may get As well as speaking about serieses The same is true of that We have this List query get series ID Sermons that we also want to change And so we not changing it in the view The idea was That if we change it in the dynamic get it automatically Right to correct code to whatever view you add it because we've added some custom Scripting Sorry placeholders within the script So let's take the first one is this sermon Where is it Sermon series So in custom script we scroll down to the bottom there is now a new Tab here option here Add PHP Pass method in routed little bit of explanation there Tick yes Any two Dynamic to load What is what I can consider the most basic implementation of that little snippet So you see it looks very familiar it's got his place holders And it has a specific It has a specific S View placeholder That's because we're dealing with the site View And it does to have this s in it To replace it with the side view name So wherever this is gonna you be used this this Dynamic get This Would be replaced with that specific site views a value Ok that's just to give you a heads up About the place holder and that's what makes it dynamic So that you can use it in any side view and it will automatically write this Because really the the display of the page is actually based on the database request right Which is built in the URL by the name of the view As well as the ID of the element And if there are multiple variables being passed To the Yeah - they are your l You can obviously update that and Replace multiple values So Here we want to within this one Did the default option here will actually resolve our issue because Remember these two values were not the same JCB Dynamic build actually change this value to Sermon instead of Leaving it The same And there is a very good reason For that Usually this would be the correct response but in this case because of complexity I'm not gonna explain It isn't the correct response and so you want these two values to be the same And it is basically the site to Vuze name So we could just save it close this The next 1 Min wanna do is this sermon preacher And it was also Having the same issue basically So we We gonna do the the same kind of Just add the the custom Option To ensure that these two values remain the same And then the last but not least was this category 1 It is also behaving Incorrectly And really it's only because it Didn't detect That this is actually category And that is primarily because it is using the Sermon table 2 - start instead In the cement table We have a joint here 2 Two category If you can see there And so it does load the category ended In the tweak You see that we are actually using This ID And this is a category ID So it should actually go look for the category And Botha the pass method based on the category And so Your We also gonna Just Add A true Today's get far Which tells the get far That method that this is actually a category This this name In effect is actually gonna be ignored Because it's gonna not be looking for this tables value is gonna go to the category table And look for the value there Ok so this will resolve this this issue We can save and close this one So now we have Done some customisation to our router Just by adding those Values to the dynamic get If we compile our components now Inner arm attic24 back onto Unto those Values Just Stolen again And I'll let's go look at the code So we see here That it did exactly what he wanted it added preacher preacher there And this is now Categories true And We see the series is series And so now at least we know that this actual The router will behave correctly This is the first step of our improvement to the router It seems to me that we already have a very workable Situation and this is really gonna make it too much better There was also the idea of adding some custom scripting into the built Method And we will look at that And I am invite You and anyone else too To get involved On this on get up just if you know how to improve his even more Then please I get in contact with me and let's let's work together This is so what we've done so far But like an all iterative developing concepts We'll continue improvement Proving this To the point where it really serves as well And holds up with changes also happening in gym about self Ok well thanks for watching
