# TWEAKING MySQL DEMO DATA

### MySQL tweaking in the component area

Open a component(in this instance 'Editting a component'), go to 'settings', and there is 'MySQL' tweak. [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m18s)  What is its function? If you have multiple versions of a component,and partly have demo that relates to a certain version of it and implementation of items, and in another version you do not want those items included, there is this 'MySQL' tweak area where a specific view can be selected that you want to tweak.[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m43s)

 NB. This feature may only be used, if you're using this area where we have added database connection between the view 'dummy data' and 'view' itself.

[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m07s) If 'Field types' is opened which is one of Component Builders own views, and it is connected to the database through 'MySQL'. If 'yes' is added and table is selected.(See video)  Then Field types is selected in the database and then let it all be taken into the 'Build' file.  [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m33s)

### Tweaking Feature

Some of the versions that are distributed with Component Builder, does not have all the field types in it. It's a limited to only a certain few field types. To explain what has been done: Return to the tweaking feature. with Component Builder open, go to settings. [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m57s) In this tweak feature, added values may be seen and certain of them like Custom Admin, has been set to 'no', do not include the add MySQL(to view table) if set in the view. [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m19s) If 'MySQL' were selected in the view, then through this(Add MySQL) feature it can be controlled which item's actual 'ids' should be included. Like in the Admin View, only these two 'ids'(33,42) have been included from the database. It is the 'ids' in the Admin View table. It is ID based. There is the feature of including all.[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m46s)  

### ID Based

It is a function that is used to indicate what is needed. If 'ids' between let say 1 and 50 are used, then this  arrow notation with an equals open bracket there(=>) can be used, to notate that between 1 and 500, you want to add. [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m15s)  

Here it says:(See video) 1,2,3,4or1=>4 a comma is placed and then 20, then another comma and then 40=>90, so you can in the same comma delimited list, add this notation to show that 1 to 4 need to be included, immediately after it add 20 and all that ids will be grabbed. [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m41s)  In fact it eliminate any other ids and only use the ones that has been notated. Here is another example of using 1,4,23,199 ; it goes on from 597=>604,682=>684.(See video) [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s)  It is in the same comma delimited list, it is made id based, and include these by clicking 'yes'. That is what it can be used for. So if dummy data or example data has not been included in the component build structure, then this area is really redundant and it is not necessary to use it at all. [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m46s) Ignore it if there isn't any data selected. That is a tweaking feature in Component Builder's component area that helps with the management of dummy data between versions in your applications.
