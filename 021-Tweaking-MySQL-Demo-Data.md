Hi You wanna look at MySQL tweaking In the component area It's open a component go to settings And then there is MySQL tweak What is this able to do is if you have multiple versions of a component And Barclay you have demo that relates to a certain version of it but and Implementation of Items And In another version you don't want those items included We have this MySQL tweak area Where you can actually First yield select that specific View That you Want to tweak And do note that you can only make use of this feature If you're actually using the This Area Where we actually add Database Connection between The View Dummy data And view itself So let me quickly show you what I mean So you're I have opened fuel types which is one of component Builders own views And I have a connected To my Database Through this MySQL I added yes I selected table And then I selected The field types In my Database And basically Just let it all be taken into the build file And Now Since you know that some of the versions that we distribute with component Builder Don't have all the field types in it And it's a limited To only a certain few field types So to show you how that was done I will go back to That tweaking Feature So here I have component builder open And if I go to settings And I go to District feature It's you that I have Added Values here Uncertain of thems like custom admin I said no don't Include non no Add MySQL to view Table if set in the view So if the if the interview if you have the MySQL select ID Are you come through this feature Control which items actual ID is Should be Included like in the admin review I'm only including these two ideas From my Database And so it's the ideas in the admin table admin view Table And I'm also saying that it's ID based You have the future of Just including all And then you have it based Saota A way to say what you want here You can also if you are using ID is between that's a 1 and 50 Then you can use this arrow Notation with an equals Open open bracket there Do you know data between 1 and like here 500 You want to add And You can actually Do it quite simply with one two three and then Comma Ok here I'm explaining it nicely it says 1234 or 124 And then you can put a comma and then 20 And then and then 40 to 90 so you can in the same comma Delimited list You can add this notation To show that we need to include 1 to 4 And is immediately after it Add 20 and we will Grab all that IBS and Impact in limonade any other ideas and only use the ones that you have Actually notated So here is another Good example Using 14 2399 So goes on in here We going from 597 to 604 82 - 680 4 And it's in the same comma delimited list And we saying is it based and we say include these So that is That is partly what I'm having why why this is hear what it can be used for So you not including dummy data or example data in your component build structure Then this area is really redundant and you don't need to even use it You can just ignore it system ignores it as if it doesn't exist If there isn't any Data selected Well that is some tweaking feature In component Builders component area That helps you Manage your Dummy data between Versions in In your applications
