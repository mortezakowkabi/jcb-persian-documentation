## Overview

In Joomla Component Builder (JCB), **MySQL Tweaks** provide a flexible way to control which demo or dummy data gets included when compiling your component.
This is especially helpful when maintaining **multiple versions** of the same component, where some versions require example data and others don't.

This guide uses the **"Editing a Component"** example to explain how the MySQL tweak works, how to use it effectively, and when to ignore it.

## 1. Accessing the MySQL Tweaking Area

[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m43s)

1. Open your component in **Joomla Component Builder**.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Locate the **MySQL** tweak area.

### What It Does

If your component has **multiple versions**, and some of them include demo data related to specific views or datasets, the MySQL tweak allows you to **include or exclude** that data per version.

This setting is particularly useful if you've linked your view to a **dummy data table** or another database source.

> **Tip:** This feature is only applicable when a **database connection** has been established between your component's view and a data source in MySQL.

## 2. Understanding How JCB Uses MySQL Connections

For example, if you open one of JCB's internal views, such as **Field Types**, and connect it to MySQL:

* Select **Yes** under *MySQL connection*.
* Choose the relevant database table.
* JCB will automatically **pull the field type data** into your component's **build file**.

This ensures all your component's data definitions are consistently included in the compiled output.

## 3. The Tweaking Feature Explained

[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m33s)

JCB comes with demo versions where not all field types are available by default.
To customize this behavior, use the **Tweaking Feature** in the settings.

[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m57s)

When you open this tweak feature:

* You'll see several configurable options (e.g., *Custom Admin*, *MySQL to View Table*).
* Some values may be set to **"No"**, meaning that data is excluded from the build.
* If **MySQL** is enabled in a view, this section lets you specify **which IDs** from that view's database should be included.

[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m19s)

For example, in an Admin View, IDs `33` and `42` may have been included from the database.
These are controlled directly through the MySQL tweak.

> **Control Data Inclusion:**
> The tweak system is **ID-based**, allowing you to define which records are packaged into your component.

## 4. Working with ID-Based Tweaks

[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m46s)

This feature gives you **fine-grained control** over what data gets included by ID.

### Syntax Format

You can specify ranges and individual IDs in a **comma-delimited list**:

```text
1,2,3,4,20,40=>90
```

This example includes:

* IDs `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`
* ID `20`
* All IDs from `40` through `90`

[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m15s)

You can also mix ranges and discrete IDs, e.g.:

```text
1=>4, 23, 199, 597=>604, 682=>684
```

This makes it easy to include **specific datasets** without manually managing each record.

[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s)

After setting your ID list, toggle **Include = Yes** to activate the tweak.

## 5. When to Ignore the MySQL Tweaking Area

[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m46s)

If your component **does not include dummy or demo data**, there's no need to configure the MySQL tweak.
It will have no effect on your build output.

> **Ignore Unused Tweaks:**
> If no data has been selected or connected in your component, this feature can be safely ignored.

## 6. Summary

| Purpose                 | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control Demo Data**   | Manage which sample or demo data is packaged into your component builds.      |
| **Version Flexibility** | Exclude data for production versions and include it for demo or dev versions. |
| **ID-Based Inclusion**  | Include records by listing their database IDs or specifying ranges.           |
| **Optional Feature**    | Only needed if your component integrates dummy data tables.                   |

## Key Takeaways

* Access the **MySQL tweak** in component **Settings**.
* Connect your view to MySQL if you want to include real or demo data.
* Use **comma-delimited ID lists** to specify which entries to include.
* Skip this step entirely if your component doesn't use demo or example data.

> **Pro Tip:**
> MySQL Tweaks are especially powerful when used in **multi-version component development**, helping you maintain clean data separation between production and demo builds.
