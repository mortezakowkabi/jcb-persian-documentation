# TWEAKING MySQL DEMO DATA

### MySQL tweaking in the component area

Open a component(in this instance 'Editting a component'), go to 'settings', and there is 'MySQL' tweak. [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m18s)  What is its function? If you have multiple versions of a component,and partly have demo that relates to a certain version of it and implementation of items, and in another version you do not want those items included, there is this 'MySQL' tweak area where a specific view can be selected that you want to tweak.[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m43s)

 NB. This feature may only be used, if you're using this area where we have added database connection between the view 'dummy data' and 'view' itself.

[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m07s) If 'Field types' is opened which is one of Component Builders own views, and it is connected to the database through 'MySQL'. If 'yes' is added and table is selected.(See video)  Then Field types is selected in the database and then let it all be taken into the 'Build' file.  [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m33s)

### Tweaking Feature

Some of the versions that are distributed with Component Builder, does not have all the field types in it. It's a limited to only a certain few field types. To explain what has been done: Return to the tweaking feature. with Component Builder open, go to settings. [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m57s) In this tweak feature, added values may be seen and certain of them like Custom Admin, has been set to 'no', do not include the add MySQL(to view table) if set in the view. [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m19s) If 'MySQL' were selected in the view, then through this(Add MySQL) feature it can be controlled which item's actual 'ids' should be included. Like in the Admin View, only these two 'ids'(33,42) had been included from the database. It is the 'ids' in the Admin View table. It is ID based. There is the feature of including all.[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m46s) <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<, 

### ID Based

So it's a way to say what you want here. You can also if you are using ids between let say 1 and 50, then you can use this arrow notation with an equals open bracket there(=>), to know take between 1 and 500, you want to add. [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m15s) And you can actually do it quite simply, over here I'm explaining it nicely, it says 1,2,3,4or1=>4 you can put a comma and then 20, then another comma and then 40=>90, so you can in the same comma delimited list. You can add this notation [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m41s) to show that we need to include 1 to 4. And immediately after it add 20 and we will grab all that ids. In fact it illuminate any other ids and only use the ones that you have actually notated. Here is another good example of using 1,4,23,199 [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s) so it goes on in here from 597=>604,682=>684. It's in the same comma delimited list, and we saying is it's id based, and we say include these(yes). That is partly what I'm having, why this is here, what it can be used for. So if you're not including dummy data or example data in your component build structure, then this area is really redundant and you don't need to even use it all. [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkSLZUEN-RE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m46s) You can just ignore it system, ignores it as if it doesn't exist if there isn't any data selected. Well that is some tweaking feature in component builders component area that helps you manage your dummy data between versions in your applications.
