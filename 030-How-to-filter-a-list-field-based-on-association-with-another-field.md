Perhaps you encountered the necessity to limit the drop downs of a list field based on it's association with another table. A very common place where this occurs, is for example, when the regions of only one country need to be loaded. Although there are many ways to accomplish this, this is how I have done it. 

* ### Example Component With Filters

[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m43s)

For example: Here is a component called 'Job Tracking'.  In this component is a client area. If you go to Admin Views, it may be seen that there is 'Country' and 'Regions'. The field concepts can be changed and replaced with other tables.(See video) [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m16s) Here follows a explanation of how it is implemented in the client's view because that's where most of the work is done. JavaScript, as well as the PHP area are two areas that should be looked at. [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m51s)In various previous tutorials some of the Ajax functionality in Component Builder had been explained.   

For the sake of those who have not watched all the tutorials, here is a brief explanation. But first it should be determined what is our objective. [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m19s) When starting with a client a country needs to be selected. Let it load only that country's regions. [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m41s) Furthermore you want to make sure that when you unselect the Country, it also unselects the Region. 

There are various things that need to be accomplished here. This will be illustrated in JavaScript.  [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m10s) If the country "Australia" is used for example, it will be seen that it does not load any regions, in fact it shows: 'Create a region'. If Namibia is being selected, it indicates 'Select a region', and so there's two regions already created. There is this button(see video) in some of the drop downs which are being added by selecting 'true' to the button. It's very helpful for either creating or editing existing regions. So if a country is selected where there is not any regions set yet, it tells you to create one.[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m44s)  Then a region can be created for this country, If 'Create' is selected, then your region may be created. Save and close. Call it 'Region' for example. Save and close. Go back to Creating a client. [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m17s) If Australia is selected it shows that it got 'Regions'.  

To demonstrate how that was done: 

### Two Variables - Var Regions(object) Var Region(store)

[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m30s)

Let's get started on a JavaScript side of things. There are two variables. Both may be called 'var'. One is an object and one is where a value is going to be stored, only if that value is already set. When the fields are  Created, all the regions is brought to the page, no region should be left unloaded. [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m11s) Rather parse those regions into this variable, only then put those regions that are part of this country back into the list of drop down options.[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m43s) It is been done for 'each(funtion()' on the regions options.(See video) and then I'm getting the value, then it is put in 'var'key, then get the 'text', and place it in 'var'text, and add it to regions'Key=text'. Simply as it is loaded in any array. [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m08s) Then take the value of the set region(see video) and add that to 'Region', and the function 'getregion' is set.  

### Loading Show - Class ID

[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m23s)

First load the 'jQuery("#loading"),show);'   Now this 'show' or rather the class ID, is loaded on the page by default when Fade in Affect is set on 'Add'. Then by default loads that class with a spinner. If the loading process takes long the user is incapable from doing anything, [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m58s) It is not necessary to add that. Then look for the options 'find('option')' for the region, and remove all of them. Then an update is triggered. This update that gets triggered here 'lizt', is a Joomla function. [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m19s) It is possibly going to change in the future.  Keep in mind that if things break, it is possible happening right here, because this list field is dynamically generated by Joomla.  Only after everything has been removed, it may be told to draw that list again. 

### GetRegion

[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m51s) So up till here only the region had been touched. Now get the country value that have been selected and add it to 'country'. Then call the server at this point. The only thing which is given to the server is the 'country' ID. Up here is a 'country' ID. We have our getUrl. In this case 'getRegion' is the task. [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m16s) Then check if the token is on the page and make sure that a country ID is not zero. A request is loaded and an Ajax is send.

 It is done this way because some things need to be performed after we have got the result which is this 'done'.   [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m40s) Then  'setRegion'. The result is placed into 'setRegion', hide the 'load', and then do some house cleaning on the 'button'. In this instance the button got tampered with. There is a correction region button below.(See video) [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m05s) This code may be copied and tested. Update 'region' to whatever field you are trying to limit but only do that after 'setRegion'. 

### SetRegion

SetRegion is quite simple, mainly because most of the work had already been done, with the result being returned. (It gets returned by PHP). [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m38s) Get an array in 'setRegion', and check if the array is there, and then 'append'. Simply as with any list selection, 'append' the value.

* ### Strings - Select_A_Region, Create_A_Region

[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m55s)The 'select_a_region' is a JavaScript variable that gets set through PHP, which will be discussed at later stage. Basically it's just a string that says that the region should be selected. [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m21s) If there is no array returned, other variable should be used, the 'create_a_region' which is also just a string.

 Go to 'jQuery.each(array,function(i,id){' , select 'array' and use the 'id', and check if the 'id' is in 'regions'. If it is in 'regions', append the 'id' as a value. As you remember in 'regions' the text as well as the 'id' had been saved. [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m51s) So that is how to get the text, simply adding it in there(see video). It could have been done in the PHP, but I felt let the browser help us with some of the lifting. There is regions, if it's a huge table it should be approached differently. Eventually it is checked whether the 'id' and the 'region' equals(id==region). Since if it does it is necessary to ensure to set the 'region' value.

  [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m25s) As you remember we found the region value, and stored it into 'region'. Just in case the value was set before and saved and now the person is looking through different countries. But when he again select the country that previously was saved, we want to make sure that this previous region is also shown as the selected value. That's simply what we are doing here(jQuery(#jform_region)val(id)). Then after everything is done we again trigger this liszt:Updated. [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m58s)  Which is the same as what was triggered there(see video). That sets the Regions List again afresh. Then do we run this(see video) bit of housekeeping which is done by the region button. 

### RegionButton Correction 

[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m22s)The region button is actually JavaScript that is added because of the List field. If a specific list field was set to have no button, then simply leave this out. If it was set to have a button, the name of the button would be this area before the 'jform'_. This part of the name('region') would be the first part of the name of the button function, and then the last part would be button. [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m54s) So that's how it can execute and search for this 'regionButton' function on the page , if there is any uncertainty. That's how to run the Button Correction. That is how the JavaScript looks that performs this. This area of JavaScript can actually include PHP.[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m25s) That area can not because that's just a pure JavaScript file where this is JavaScript added to a PHP file. Here may be added some PHP and that's where to get the 'select_region' and 'create_region'. 

### JavaScript - AdminForm.on(change) 

There is another way to do this in Javascript. There's this function, the 'adminForm.on(change)' of the country field and when that event occurs, we want to execute 'getRegion'. [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m06s) That is done every time that field is changed. That is the extra Script that needs to be added to these two if you are going to copy this. That will execute this function which is the same function that are executed on the page load.[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m33s)  It is not necessary to execute this because that is already been done on the page load. That is all the JavaScript that  needs to be added. 

### PHP - Ajax Method - Model - Controller

It is not necessary to add the PHP to the same Admin view, since all the Ajax methods are all added to one file in the component called, Ajax. The model as well as the controller, is the Ajax model and controller.[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m13s) If the component is compiled it can be unzipped. Then go to the model, and to the controller, either in the back end or in the front end. Whereas for now it will be in the back end, it is under models. It may be seen that there is  an Ajax model and all of the back end Ajax methods gets added to this one model. So this 'php ajax method' area is what takes care of the model. [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m37s) And this 'Ajax input - add' area here takes care of the controller. So the value's name is 'country', the task is 'getRegion', if no values is passed it is Null. It must be an integer that is past, and the method name is 'getRegion' and it must be a login user. That takes care of the whole controller setup. 

[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m08s)  Then here is the method('php ajax method') called 'getRegion', it gets the ID. It doesn't need to sanitize it again since the controller already did that. At the controller may the implementation be seen. So we simply getting the factory, the data base factories passes us the database. A query need to be set up , that requests the ids in the region that are published. [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m38s) This is again where the changes need to be done. We want the IDs of the regions on their association with the country. Then in the region table, we have a field, a column, that is called 'country'. It has an 'id' in it. [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m06s)



 So that each region is linked to a country. Whatever table you're targeting, this association would be this country. Add the interger again, set the query, execute it and check if you have a value. If there is a value simply return the 'loadcolumn' function, [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m33s) which returns the 'id' in an array.  And then  return 'false', if no value was found. That is all the PHP necessary. That returns the PHP to the JavaScript and the JavaScript does the rest. [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h17m57s) This will help to sort your dropdowns. 

### Filtering a Dropdown

The fields that are being focused on is this Country and this Region Field which are both custom. Tutorials had been done on how to set up a Custom Field. Just for a reminder: Open Region. In Region the button is set on true ('button="true"'). [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h18m34s) The region is selected, the view name can be dynamically updated in the description. In here(XML field definition) some PHP is done. All of this PHP may be placed in 'type_PHP_1' without adding it to the 19th placement.  Every area had been used.[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m05s) I prefer to let the code appear as it had been written and not computer-generated. Options is added, and so this is just a  basic Custom field without any JavaScript in it.   Everything had been done in back end Admin View, the PHP as well as the Javascript.[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h19m44s) I preferred to use this field maybe in other views with different associations. So I don't tend to use the script area maybe as one might expect. So that's quickly looking at filtering a dropdown Custom list selection via JavaScript and Ajax.[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8FLifQOjUk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h20m15s) If you are targeting a table of another component which you do not have control over the actual field names, it will work the same way as long as there is a field of association within the table that you like to filter, you could write that PHP, find the values and filter it.
