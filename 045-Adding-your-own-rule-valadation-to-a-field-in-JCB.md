I would like to demonstrate to you How to add rules to your Model Basically to a field Adding rules to a field Uses your custom rules to Tester value Before actually You know submitting it to the database so this is a quite good feature Do actually have in your component Now I'm just gonna use this hello world component the one we we actually The whole world tutorial on and I'm gonna add a rule to one of its Fields and then Then quickly type it up And show you how to include it Ok so I've gone to admin views I'm gonna open this greeting First As the admin view we want to change the field in it I think that's used is greetings And let's add a rule That we can call something like Are we see at this time That the field attributes don't have the validation Option switch in place So We might start shipping JCB with this new validation property was not new just Just helping at it yet but if you have a version of Daisy bead it doesn't have it set Then whatever field type you've selected you can edit the field I'm going here Or You could edit the fuel type By going to feel types So this have to close out of this again And then hear fuel types And you can select the field type that you want to add this validation to we want to do it for now just Text area This one And it has a filter in place I think I'm gonna add validation just on the leaf it So just go click Your class It is a duster bill It's not required it's not translatable and let's give it a little this Description ok so I think they got it all set I wouldn't add a value here because If if you don't want to use it you just leave it empty And ok that's basically it's Avon closed so we've done the text area Now Let's go back to our Admin view greetings Again open that field Now we have this validate a property available to us So we can all copy it And added it here Now we want to have a custom validation here There are built in Joomla validations as well But you can also set up a custom validation rule and this is what are formed Roulette is slow This is what we want to demonstrate So we gonna say Let's call our rule then 10 So my string must be longer than 10 characters Ok I think that should do So I'm just gonna copy this again And 7 clothes Now that we've got our validation set JCB is not yet able to We don't have an area for you to write the rule and have it be included So the way you do this and I think it's it's efficient Is it you right up the file yourself you put it in the custom folder of JCB And you include it into the component So that it places it in the correct place You see the one thing that I should be ready does for you Is that it creates a folder called rules and in the forms Every XML If we open it For the ready has a field path Andrew Pass So you you can just add your rule to this Basically to this folder Without them is straight to you in the moment But first let's create a rule So I had it this room here so in the folder structure I'm basically in the admin area components component builder and there is a folder called custom An inside of this folder I've Now created this stud 10 file Sterling 10 file and then it I placed this this code here Basic J form rule nothing too fancy about it Ok let's see now that we've got our file in place We need to add it into our component So we go to the components and we open that component And we go to Settings and they're adding custom files and folders We click on this component files and folders create component files and folders For this Tumelo component We just click on that it's ok And here we want to add 1 file Since we've added it to that custom folder everything in at custom folder will come up as a file that you can Select So there this that file Now the path to where we want it to place the file So in the back and of the component we go to Models Forms And we are targeting this breeding form so we opened that and we C That it has models rules So That's copy that How many to remember that it is admin at the admin area And then Models rules So This admin is basically the way the package is built so the target Place should be the place in Inside the package this be always the case for both folders and fields So in the Folder You want it to add it to the admin models rules folder And then you need to decide whether you want this file to be updated Now the state that fathers and need any updating But hey we can change that So you can see I've just added this New licence tag to it And I've added this bomb Basically when the file gets taken It will Take this part away and replace this with your components licence and so the fight I will basically be Become Branded like every other file in your In your component Anna Even if you use it in areas or components Other than the one you originally made it for it will just dynamically looked like it was made for it because it Add that components Data at the header of the file and even if you had the components name somewhere else in this You can actually replace it with the well-known Hash hash hash component has shows us and it will be placed with the comp Ok enough of that we've got our file in place You wanted to be updated And now let's compile the component and see it in action So you're just take this as yes it's the file should be updated And then save and close Auto close out of a component again There's no shortcut to that file area over here that you can use We go to the compiler And we compile our component Ok it's done now let's install our component Now let's go look at the code to see what happen Ok so here is our components admin area If we open the rules we see how there is a file it was play Placed into this folder If we open that file we said hi It added our Copy notice to the header of the file And now let's also look at our XML Scroll down We see the validation is there still n da 10 so Everything so far so good Now let's contestas To reopen this component in the backend We go to greetings We click new How's your member We said that greetings now needs to have a length Of at least 10 Characters So let's test this So we add greeting which isn't enough and we click save And it tells us Invalid field readings Problem There's one little change I had to make to get this to work and I realise how he tell you ok let's go look at For some reason they want this file or lowercase so I had to change turtle N to the T Also lower so this could do this Also with the file in our custom folder Then Inside of the actual file they also want the tea here to be lowercase I suppose because they are using the upper case camera rule To sort of break-up the the name Let's see ok so that was what I had to do to get it to work Now I also need to just update the component to include this file since the name is changed it will no longer know where it is Siri open the component You know what Let's not open the components go directly to that file Area Weather shortcut And we see it so long as selected to a scroll down select it again and save and close That should do it Ok so now that we've fixed the little glitch which I created myself Let's go back to see this again in action And save And invalid field greetings Ok that isn't very helpful Maybe you would like to also show a custom message So that the user word least know more about what is going on here But now before we do that let's add enough L use and see if that it actually saves And now it's saved excessively close So our greetings been saved and how value here is more than 10 characters So it was valid Now let's go add a custom message to our Validation Remember whatever you do to the live version of this file Will my bestest Hurley become part of the next compilation So adding a custom message you need to actually go back 2 component builder custom And to that actual file And add it in there then recompile your component and it will automatically Update the life demonstration So the other way just a test before doing it live or be another 4 Adding it to the core of your component is to actually go to the live file which as we saw is I'm here in Hollywood Models Rules Sterling 10 Good Dallas adult custom message in here just to test Ok Using the element and adding an atom attribute to the element message Fuel past have more than 10 characters That is one way of doing this of course there is another way Again this takes us back to JCP And we go to the field We open greetings And we look for the attribute message It doesn't have message So we need to add this attribute with click on field type And we scroll down I think let's place this on the description So we say Message Changeable It is translatable And it's optional so We don't make it compulsory Ok we got all set So To save and close Now Let's add this validation sorry the message To our field Number for we saved this and actually go this path let's first test our live Change we made to the file and see if that also works So in the Fire we added this attribute To the element And basically return false Good now let's go test this So we gonna open that item I will take away a few characters And click save There we get a message that it needs more than 10 characters Ok great so that option also works very well Outlets to use the other one which I suppose is more convenient Unless you are checking multiple things and you would like to give multiple error messages based on the The results then this implementation is the better option but if you just got one message and it just needs to We really explain to the user one issue Been using the XML path I suppose is more convenient So in our custom file we haven't added that change so Let's go and compiler component and install 1st May to save and close out of this Field so that the changes be captured Then go to the compiler And compile Are component Install Let's go look at the code Here in the code we see our custom messages again not showing up Maximum greeting when I have this translated message here She can see Risco testers So again we open that field And first let you save it the way it is Ok good it works let's take away 2 characters and save again And we get the expected message this time around that message can be translator And is well it is actually in the XML file it's not part of the actual function Ok well so I think this covers it We have now successfully added Our own validation rule 21 Field within a view And we were able to include that rule into our component on compilation are using adding custom Files Thank you for watching
