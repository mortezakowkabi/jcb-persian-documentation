Hi We are looking at admin views Which is The next thing to be setting up In Developing your car So first we started with Fuel types Looking at How to setup your types of improve on them Then We looked at how to use those field types to build Basic Common fields Now we gonna look at how to take those fields And add them To admin views Admin views Like I explained in our initial General planning Video It is basically from the BedRock The basis of your Components database structure Do admin views is where your Database Structure is being Developed All your admin views which have their own table Nice we explained admin views have a single Name and it has a list record Your name And then there is a sister name And the reason why there they actually have Is that let's say you have Wanna reuse this Specific admin View In another component With the same name but obviously adapting it to that component The idea would be that you would then have to preacher Showing up in your selection list When you added to the component And so that might be difficult to discern Which is which And so You can add the name of that specific component As part of Just differentiating between The same Names That means you can have Admin views with the same name But with different implementation Fact that is how You can do different version control Concepts on Components Using the same admin do Just inside of it Making a few changes and in Saving it So you could do that Open preacher for example And India You could say free virgin This is the free version and then say there's coffee Then you can Change the field that is linked You can change some of the link views You can change some of your CSS will whatever Are there things you have done Regarding this admin review And then go to the free version of that component And Link the That specific one That is if you instead of the other Anyway maybe I'm getting head of myself I usually So let's focus now Great mutton you your busy just kick new I'm gonna run Open Twitter again because this is the one we are using As a restoration And You would See that there should be a name for a single record Again that is where you would edit This records so that is In this case I said preacher And then there is a list of Records And that's preachers Then a short description And a normal Justice scription Depending on What you would like to say Then there is a type now the read write and the read only Changes the components editing Have you If you say read only Then it will basically limit The fields to being not you will not be able to edit them If you remember in the In this area wait Here The modified by field cannot be edited Because it's done automatically and when it was modified is Is also updated us every time you You click save So this area count be edited and that's how all The fields are gonna look If you select Read on If you if you leave it on read write it will look like this I know you will be able to edit it Ok so that is Looking at this Fields now there is a place for an icon Via over the icon It gives you the dimensions that is This basically is the icon Then when you look At The dashboard These icons Are the one selected there Ok so You can see that The icon has two of them one is the add icon And one is there just a normal icon so if I have our year You should see the image of Set in In your In yours Images folder sorry So if you open this It goes to your image father is select the icon When your helper here obviously those images In this And then if you gonna add creatures are you if you gonna add a field Just a field Call category that is of the category type Then you should add a category icon Since then The system will automatically know ok then easily category setup And I'll look for this icon to use For that category And If you select Category field that is a general category for the whole component Which isn't directly linked To this View Then it will take the first view This is the mall look at which view when it processes it Which view is the first one And usually that would be the first one you Created And it will use the icon in that But to be on the safe side if you using 1 category for the mall Just said the same icon on them all But if you are gonna use a category Which is primarily focused on the preachers And you just gonna put preachers and a category Then you need to add a category I can't hear Four categories Download permission on switch It's got to do with your accessing and Updating of data So like you can see here We have View edit View edit State View edit own Views create Admin views delete Induce access at the new edit version Now this edit If it's set if your own this managing group and it set to a loud then you can edit it If you are a guest and it said to Deny I no Matter Where You are in The front or the back of the site You won't be able to edit Formation even if you have a Direct Link It won't allow you to edit it Now in also has view axe So somebody who might be not allowed to Edited May be allowed to View This Disdain Taunting in the backend in the listview Then it will show in the list view and they can see that it is there Now you might Think yourself why would ever wanna do that And you see because of your custom admin Views and the way that you can connect them to your admin views Which will look at later You might want to display the record and Just leavin custom admin link 2 To the data Let me give show an example of a Component that does that You see here There is a button underneath The camp the company name So I just played the record But If I was Like this one whose profile is set to To being locked If I was to click on this You tell me That I do not have the permission to edit it But if I was to click on this icon It actually loads the information that I Looking for And That is the difference The differences sometimes you wanna use a custom see this is a custom Admin View And you might want to Do something That is not Editing view but a custom View And then you would like one too Be able to see the record but not edited So that's really what What that is all about Ok so We are back here And we are looking at the missions So Opening this permission tab You'd see that there is edit a view edit View edit home View edit state and All these have been created usually when you open this it might look like That Look like that So you would set the first one and that you would see there are Two options one is core edit and one is view and it The core edit Means That You want to do a global Switch Now Let me try and explain that by opening Composite Builders options We haven't actually looked at this yet but it You see that it all components in Joomla you have what is called the great edit Delete Edit State edit own Is this list Of options Which means that if you select This ad You know that they can't create something Then It is applicable to Everything in this component Because it's a global setting so Everything that doesn't have a view name behind it Like this is a view name And it says access This is a view name Minutes but use But this is only bad shoes So that's the global for but use and this is only related to this view So you can say I am allowing them to Do a batch function But in this atman view I don't Want to allow Sorry Don't wanna allow them To do a batch from Or you could say You know what I wanna use inheritance So that means I'm gonna do that I want them to be able to do but from since here And in this view Now the reason why you can do it in two places then Is that you have a global switch to stop them from doing it But you can also locally to the view Tweak whether they are able to To edit Do some of these features So coming back to the Way that you would set that up If you don't want to have a separate Control For this View In relation to whether they can edit it or Or whether you could Change it all view it all these Possibilities Then you would you score Amkor with me that you would have only this one switch And if you say deny it will it automatically tonight for that View And any other view that is using Call or Who can be seen as Global When when you are setting it as View Interview It means that the system will generate A specific list of items Specially just for that View So if you look From there to there That's for your admin View They're too bears for your custom Admin View No that means When I sit up This in a component Builder I selected view edit And then I said in relation to each record in relation to the whole View And I selected Both So Then it will implement it for the For both And single record and it will improve minuted For your Global settings Now again it might feel I won't blame you with what I have just tried it Explaining Makes you feel calm Fused But Really The only way for you to make sense of this is if you know how to mulhouse provisional structure works So if you are using and you're my website And you have actually ever Gone to articles And opened options In a look at their permissions Then you'd see that they only have create edit Delete Edit State edit own And then these accessing of the control And this back silly This pic Global settings Now what we are doing as we simply adding More control Then only these default because the way this works In article manager you basically have 1 view That view is Arctic These are the views On S categories is another view but it really has another component It's not really Content The content component An admin features Is just another implementation It's not really a whole new Database It's ok so the point is You only really have to wear the most two views here And so when they look at options They know that if they tweak this permission they want it to be implemented For all the views related to article Well this component Builder you are able to build component Drop are bigger Then the company managing Article manager Ok I'm because of that We felt that your permissions must extend That you can target a specific view and not just all of them at once So if you want to Target a specific View You will select The View edit Actually this view Prefix Must be in your selection If you select Core That means you are saying I don't want to specifically target this view If I change it in the global settings which would be The ones without a view name in Front Everything Farm Here There Does other global settings Global export Global batch Mobile version Edit version Global create Delete Edit edit State not edit state is changing it from publish to unpublish those things Edit own means you might not have edit rights but he has in it own rights So that means whatever you create c can edit again In an egg Raid by is a field So Canada created by field Or Canada to create date field Now You'd see that This basically targets Fields that are sort of the default fields There is a way to Target Custom Fields Fields that were developed Outside of the default fields But that is not done in Here Show you where that is done this is just controlling your default Fields and your default Features with regards to Permissions And So you would first set up these permissions make sure that you set up all of those that you want to implement There is a list here of those I think is most general This might Grow with time But because we've moved The control of a single field Out of this Structure It actually means that we've made it scalable So this Promotional implementation here Is really only Target in your Your default fields All the fields that Already the system put in for you And the default Concepts like accessing This specific View Or deleting an item in the view or creating an item Or editing the created Field or editing the created by field Changing the state Edit own So those are the custom Default features If you wanna do a control on a specific field I'll show you that in a moment But That is the implementation Of permissions If you do not really Understand this I would suggest you make Effort To study up on Gmail as an implementation Sorry Off The promotional structure Then once you've really understood the ways umelala Handles this promotional structure Then you would have better grips on Setting up these poem Emissions Purview What is done in the code if you would like to see that It's basically in the code If your ready have developed a Component You see that it sets up Your blue balls This is the global now when I say Global I mean If you click on options Close this If you click on this button year options in any of the components You're going to the global settings Ok And These permissions here R Zoe's first that I've highlighted So it all goes And they have Links To the specific Views so there is the field View There is the Dynamic get view there is the custom admin View And you can see that they have there Related switches Ok but then there's also For each view their own Section And that causes jumala Do ad in an item a permission or tab With switching to control the permission for this one Individual item And We have tried our very best To implement these permissions actually The way that you want my dick I can in later videos going to the code and show you exactly how This permission structure is being implemented I think it's one of the features that makes component Builder Farm with balanced Then other component Builders out there Is the ability to add permissions structures to your component write inside of component Builder Through This Promotional switch Ok And so we will will definitely be speaking about this permission or structure As we go along The tap structure if you look at these we call them tabs Settings field CSS JavaScript PHP my Published And permissions The Publishing permissions R Pubs that are built Automatically For all Back end Admin views Would admin views Have this permission and while the permission only if if set And Published Will always be there In published we basically bundle your York the fields that are built Dynamically Without you having to set them What what With probably seeing all those Fields that you donate do not need to set Are always placed in Publishing And so everything else this MySQL tab year the PHP JavaScript CSS Fields and settings Are actually make sample of what tabs can be Now in preacher I actually setup Two tabs 1 quart Details And one called sermons Ok so there are two tabs in preachers So that means if you were to open the preacher Back in View First one would be called settings The second one will be called Sermons and then you'd see publishing and permission So that's how I would look Now when you create fields You see that there is a column here called tab And you then will select the number now the tags Are number from one tooth Whatever We don't start at zero or though that might have made more sense for programmers We started with One So first tab second tab And Because we are using A place different From the tabs we don't use the names So you need to remember that this is Dad one this is dad too So when you set up a field You need to tell us in which tab Do you want a place that feel Ok So That is what this tab Number here is All about Now you might say but where is tattoos in formation because they're sermons right Wow Because of the fact that sermons Is it actually A table on its own If we go out here We will see that there is a Apple viewport sermon And it is his own A bakkie in View And it has its own structure So How can I Get The sermons That is only related to this Preacher To be showing in the second tab for sermons What we created the thing called linked views The link views is the place where this is done So basically I selected sermon as the view I said it should Be placed in the second tab And in childcare Is preacher so if I think about sermons Which is the child Sermon is the child Preacher is the parent So you would always think of the parent as this the view in which you are the moment you are setting up the link View So that If you are in preacher The parent is preacher If you are in sermons The parent is sermon So depends on in which view your busy editing And so yeah When we talk about the child key This would be the database field name That that is to be looked at And the parent Field name that should be found inside of this So when we look at preachers Youth let's go back to Sermon Close this Ok we got cinnamon open here and if I open there his fields I don't need you Hair factory Easier to see Let's go to fields You see that there is a field called name Ok wait there's a field called Preacher Space Parodies Sorry Ok so this is the field That we want Connect to to With each other right So do to get The sermons that belongs to that preacher We need to get the ID of this field now that's a custom feel And we said that we are gonna look at custom fields Only after explaining the app Reviews so I'm gonna go into detail now But I'm gonna open that field None the less And I'm gonna show you that it's name is pretty And because that field Will be connected 2 sermon it means that in the database D i d Which is the key field Is gonna be saved in preacher So that means the ID of the preacher Is safe inside of the preacher Column In the database I need to show you that in the database itself Ok so here I am in the database With Suman distributor And I'm opening sermons And you'd see that we would scroll Until we see preacher And it has ID is in it And those are the ideas of the Preacher's themselves So if I was to go to preach sure Basically means that we are linking To this ID here Ok So Going back to our Link via concept That means the child Database table In which the ID of this preacher must be Found Is in preacher Apparent Key Would be this preachers ID And so by doing that The link that you will only show the servants That are related Do this Specific preacher And that is how the link views can be linked If you didn't select these correctly it won't load all of them Ok At work well So there needs to be that tight relationship Between the parent and the child View So Did there's also way To actually link An array from an array So let's say The person is able to select more than one preacher There is a way for you to also Type that but that would all be dealt with in advanced A concepts Since that is Well I could Explain some of it The best B That would be one of the syntax to use But like I said Think I possibly need to deal with this and advanced concepts Because we will know to look for the answer in this video So we'll stay with the basics here So the basic Way of linking a Another view would be to select that View From this dropdown Then say in which tab Then What is the child's Database table in which to look What is the parents value to use Doom 2 Build a relationship And then this add new button or no Is basically done when you look at a Close this When you look at Fields here You see it has a new button So you can in that switch there decide whether it should Show it would not I should tell you that if you say yes And you have In that view created the correct permission of structure 4 Whether somebody can create An item You can control the display of that New button With just setting the permission of that uses specific So if that user is in a group that doesn't have permissions to Create new items for 4 In this example 4 Preachers of sermons Then that new button will also not show up So we have that permission or wrapped Rounded buttons display method Ok That is so The Dubs Just looking at the tabs That's really what we were looking at And then explain to you The how to link Custom view also other views To it To other views So that you can have the data displayed inside if you tell her Basically this feature we have here So the fact that we are busy in preachers and we are able to display the fields That are being used Well As you can imagine These fields Are linked to preachers From this column here So we are using a Repeatable field structure And we are able to Lick Connect The field names To this View Now let me show you how I did that so I'm Looks like I'm gonna show you anyway Ok I'm opening the admin The View Which is the one we looking at I'm going to link two views And you see that I have there and are in the pointer And the world field So if you are Trying to connect A View to a To the From the parent An independent it is stored in at fields That's the database Caller Name so if we go to the database Go to Component Builder Admin views And we Wrong You see there's ad fields And if I open that You see that the way it stores it Is it stores the ID is then it stores the list So there's a way in which your Repeatable fields are stored by Joomla And the value that I need to look up is in field So in the repeatable field called up Feels There is a field called field And it should look for the ID of the Sorry of the Feels So it's looking at fields In the field Array For the ID is That it needs to fetch And the way you were it's not that in the Connect a A link to you As you would say that this is a capital R Four repeatable Fields basically that is the convention to To tell the system it's a repeatable field we looking in And inside of the repeatable field We must look in the Field array For those ideas and they should map to the child's ID So does that make sense I hope so Because that's the way it's done And if that wasn't a repeatable field but an array You would simply say your a And If if the array is just the values themselves you would drop off any pointer to Specific value But if it's an array with And it's actually a So if it's an associative array You would just add tin name Of the Dissociative key That it needs to look If it's just a normal day without Association Leave it So this would just tell the system it isn't her a And it needs to look Inside of those values for these ideas Ok so that's sort of explains the linking of an admin View To another admin View Now I'm getting on with The Setting up of fields Now since we've already created the field Beforehand You will Usually start out this way It all looks like that And the fields that you have created you would scroll down Eduloan list You just start with typing that Fields name Sorry for bringing it up to you Then it tells ask you whether you should Would like to show this field in the admin View The admin list for you And that means If you've closed Your Editing area There is a list of names here And if you want That specific field to show up in this list Then you would select Show If you select it show you could tell us in which order you wanted Must be the first one second one And we fought while you shouldn't do more than 100 look that Ridiculous So you can say I want this one too Now The title and Ali is concept in July Is is quite interesting An obviously It's actually needed Especially if you want to do History control Or Integration with Jamal is infrastructure and comes 2 there is 3 and tagging You need to add A title and a Alias to all your items Sorry to all your views Especially if it's of you that is gonna be used in the front So in this case since we are gonna use preachers in the front to display list of features Most certainly gonna add a title and we gonna use the name as the title Then again back to the backend Do we want to have this water bill so Do we want this thing to be clickable there So you can click on it And it sort the table Alphabetically On the basis of this table Sorry column So if you wanna have it sorta bill Dendi Wanted I have this Field be searchable Do you want someone to type into this box We take warehouse for example Type it in their search Do you want it to Show Only that Specific So if you want them to be able to search for it You say yes Then the filter option is a tricky one You don't wanna set name to filtering because then it will show a list of all the names that already is being shy Town in the table Only one of yous fault there on things that are like a radio box Score a a Other View all You know Fields that actually are not all being displayed one of In the table so for our example I added let's go Go to summon distributor and preacher I added No extra Fields there but it's sermons I added preacher So there is a list of all the preachers here so I could surf and say ok I don't want to see this pictures Sermons and then it shows up only those so that is the filters and the way that you said The filter is simply by clicking yes or no here and it will set up that that filter for you Then this link if you are setting up it custom field and you want to be able to In the display of the list have it clickable so I can click here and actually go Do that preacher and then click close and then I'm back in the Sermons list view I could also click on series and all take me to the series and I can edit the The series immediately click close and take me back to the list of you so if you want that Feature for the specific item then you need to tick yes here now usually were used Is the name as you see here to be the clickable field the title sorry If you select your title here and you click League then you're Actually Telling us that this item this field item here is actually what we should use Use as the clickable option to open that actual sermon So you will have that actual sermon opening up and all it's related field So that is the way for us to know which field should be used as the key If you have a title now This concept is something that you might need to play with and since it's so easy to change it you can just click about Near compile your component install it look at it behaviour change it in the compiler installed it Look at it and by doing that you'd get a good understanding of what What happens if you change the switch Ok now we said that we wanted the preachers name and stuff on the settings And our Tab 4 settings as the first half now we gonna look at the back and setup in Off where you wanna have this Fields display now there are these different Placing options left in tab right in tab full width in tab a Bathtub underneath Dubs left of Dubs right of tabs and then There is the order in which it should go that means if we look at this again This is left in tab this is right in tab I think I have a Another view that goes be on some of those parameters let me go to this one And we do question So that is right off Tab not in tab you see there is an option Write in tab left in tab and then it says left off tabs and right Of tabs now that means that you can put it out Side of the tub area So even if I was to click here it will remain displayed right there on the And that is to put it a right off tab know there's also a left of that area over here Then a bathtub is this one here that's about the tabs so it also shows all the time and And then there's underneath dad so we basically added the option of Placing data At the rear right in tab left in tab and then right Off right after up and left after and about the up and Bonita which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 positions in the backend of your Template and the places are being set simply by these alignment assignments So select the fuel alignment inside the tub or view and you select these and there Then once you've selected them let's say you've selected left in 3rd like this one above tab and you select 1 then this is the order in which you wanted to this play first this one Then that one left in tub this is first right in dub this one is first and then that one And poo it is a description now full with will also this will always display Under the left and right off in tub so you need to Select your left and right and then only your fool with so fool with his always the last Thing to show up in a tab and then here is the switch to add permissions to Is a specific values so if I was to say you know what I want the control Which group can edit the name field you simply need to click this yes and that would Add this field into the promotional structure dynamically and so that is how you You control the permissions of fields that's how you add Fields to a view and those are All the different switches now obviously you can only have one title preview and only have one eye Any is perfume so you should not have more than one selected and then he goes I think the cyst Nor the others but just to be safe let me tell you to set the others to know And then those that are actually the title two years and the one that's actually the earliest do yes And so we will be able to here I'll be sure to use the correct field values And then when you said any of these to show you should set the order of their this Display year and ok so there is the filter the filter then is add a pandemic Le Simply clicking a yes here so if we go to sermons as an example And we click on their Fields they have many more Fields it should help to illustrate some of these And you see that we have sermon series and we have it set up As a a a filter sermons Ceres let's see we said that too yes so that means we can sort this Romans by series that is how you said the filters for the backend remember this is primarily For the backend Although some of that information will relate to the front eventually especially this premier Missional Suites will be payable able to access it from the front if you need to buy But this is simply to add the fields to the actual the You in the backend ok if you have any questions About this please give me a heads up if you feel like haven't done a good enough job explaining this then Let me know and I'll redo this video so that's adding fields To the admin views there are much more things to explain here and I think the only thing I'll still Cover in this tutorial is the actual competitions this is an amazing feature Which goes beyond Geminis control on the show on attribute perf Field remember we looked at the show on attribute and the show on attribute can be control From control which Fields to show when you are clicking on other The fields so for example yeah we have a field called Add JavaScript if I click yes it opens this area Jarvis Script where I can add custom scripting now that behaviour are being is being controlled By this condition structure and the condition structure for sermons Are the following you can see there is a few already being set so what we will As we are first decide which field are we targeting which field do we want to Show or hide that's the behaviour do you wanna show if you or hide a field now most of the Time moves Show show means it'll be hidden unless these criterias are met So show is the one I use the most and I think most will use that mostly now here is the The list of all the fields in your system now you might say why don't you just show the fields that I've selected As part Of this view and unfortunately that feature isn't Place yet so you need to remember Which Fields you selected in the fields area and so far These Fields and you need to remember their names and then Then when you go to the conditions when you type a field like name You need to know how it's this one that's how you would link to them now I Build an option for files in a field and I wanted to show you Now this isolate and chain function is a concept which I believe would The best explained when you think about that not Only one field must start sorry be Be used to show the other one but more than one field so in this case Dropbox Auto note in sermons should not only show when fields Is Dropbox but also when built option is automatic So that both of these should be true before it shows The the Dropbox note and so you would select the field You want to control obviously you can control more than one at a time but the logic behind this Might not always work so you need to try it tested if it doesn't work come and tweak this until you Do you find it working in behaving the way you expect so most of the time You would only link one field to one validate But as soon as you have multiple Fields you use the train option so it's either isolate like This one to build option of files to show when file source is Dropbox that Isolated it isn't connected to any of the other settings here as soon as you claim it Means any other field that has this any other row is a row that has this field select It is well we'll be chained together so that it must be both being valid Dated as true before it actually will show the field so here let's look at it It says file source and you can select any of these if it said if if you know that this far File this sorry file source is a list then you can look at ok this is a list and see the List options so this is only for text and it says that only for text Fields only for text fields If it's only for texts this is only for list and radio and check ba Boxes and dynamic lists this is only for radio checkboxes this is only for list radio checkbox So and then you can say is or is not Sorry if it is Dropbox then it should show if it Is not Dropbox then it should show that is the the logic behind it Now hear this one is when you're dealing with a dynamic list unfortunately with dynamic List it's quite difficult to set these values since they are the namak And so the best way to deal with a dynamic would possibly be to leave this blank So that means that if any of the values are selected show show this We will still look at Dynamic or custom fields Sorry Dynamic list all custom Fields and we will explain Into you how to set up those custom Fields but that is basically what that option is for Most of the time we are using this is and we are when you select that specific Field me show you so if I select file source So you would select let's do that again if it if it is If the field that you've selected is a text field the system will show you that by saying Keywords for length so you can say I want if he has put in a Length of 2 characters then show so then you take you it away so So then that that's how you can use the text field now Change this to Actor that is active and that it has a length of 2 I said that's what that mean you could if you know that what you've selected is a list it was show you the But it will show you all the values and then you can remove the values that you don't want to use And The Oaks the only value that really important is that to the other side just for you so You could even just leave to that will be the same as that we are just showing you in Impact what I do is I explode the string at the pipe and I only use the first value to develop the The JavaScript to Java Script that is being written we are in the sermons Let me show you that so we would go to Brand builder admin components Sermon distributor modules Forms and then you'd see there are two there's a XML which is the fields And then there is a j s which is actually the Java Script so we open that and here is All the JavaScript that component Builder with build now if we look at this It's only these permissions sorry these Conditions ok so these are the conditions it's not even that long of a list But to implement these conditions component builder builds this JavaScript so it starts up here and all of this JavaScript is the Implementation of those things that we said that All the way down to their ok so that means what 500 lines of JavaScript gets written by component builder just by these That you set up here now I'm showing you Where the script is being written so did once you've set up these switches you can come into this Script and if you remember the field name that you are working with So for example let's look at it build option is the field and files So let's look if we can find out here There is sauce ok so it gets the value When the page is ready at 6 4th of June this course or what What is the value in it puts it in here and our first function obviously I'm using A random function name generator as you can see and it's Start with B and the next one would be B&W and so on and so on and Ok so that means you need to now to see how we implement this function hiding and Showing of the source you would search for the Wii function by Bracket air fan search ok so it's the first function And I'm basically saying is it set if it's set Then I I add a source constructor and if it's a In array is this an array checking the value weather is today If it's not an array I put it into another temporary array They we push it into the temporary if it is an array And it isn't set we just create a blank array then We do a validation here and again this you can go check So basically the function is that one Function and all that function does is it sex is it true Is it still returns true if it's not too it returns false CC it's quite simple And the value where the true or false is returned to source we put source in 2F if its true then we close that View Sorry we get the closest class hall Control group and we check is this field required if it's Be quiet and these are some homeworks that we do now if it's false then we hide it And there's also if it's required we do some house cleaning so that is simply Quick looking at the code which is being generated just buy this one switch This is not the only code there is another place and that is in the Love yourself so we can go to view and then preacher out looking at Then template and edit and then from around Here we have JavaScript again and again of a we have on Keyup for sores or on change because I'm not the system doesn't know is this a text field or Or is this a list the other what is it so we have these to check function on it and also So There is another place where source is gonna be used for a Functions just focusing on this one and so it gets the value and it runs That Funky Which is in our JavaScript file so here's the job profile there is the function so it's reusing the same Funk The moment that there is a key up or a change on that specific field so That's what I've done obviously other developers who are more advanced in JavaScript and I am getting Evolved I could show them where in component builder The Script is being generated and we can Improve this time attaclay I am not that good at JavaScript and a fact I I feel like a Probably a little bit resource-intensive here but this is the best I could do Do so far and obviously if we can improve it and if you know how to improve this then you Welcome to get involved and get help and start with a discussion on improving this interest I can tell you that this infrastructure is done in that file Course and I can show you exactly on which line This was developed a built In fact all you need to do is when you compile your component just Africa Go back to components close this Ok here we inside a component all you need to do to know where that is being built it's just stick this to yes And then it will add in the in the comments it will add a line Wine reference of where that specific script is being built ok Let's go back to the admin views we're not really finished so this is Structure that you can use to actually manipulate the conditions upon which field should show And I I really think we have done a very good implementation here Gives you so much of its possibilities of structuring and training and Working with the fields in its relationships if you want to not use this and just Use the on show then that is also gonna work just as well fact I think it will work better the only prob The answer is that it doesn't actually provide the ability to target as A text field like we have here where you can add a keyword and say ok if they if it types in And his program pill then immediately this other field will show up which is have Excellent feature I mean I don't think you can get that kind of into Chrissy with With the show on auction and furthermore It cannot look at multiple other field If they have to certain values and if it developer it's true then only show the other field Those kind of controls are not yet available in the show on implementation as far as I know and Yes I possibly would like to get involved on the get report of July and see If we can add these nice features but for now without them to opponent Builder And in component although you can implement these and we are writing the JavaScript to to manage this For you ok so that is your conditions for fields So we've looked at all of these the next one is basically the list of the fields that you have already Is selected and click save you will show a list of all the field that you've selected again any of those Field if you wanna update them you could just click on the field name in all take you to the field and you can update it The Next Step is a place for you to add custom CSS that is just related to the specific View so you can add CSS here which is for the interview or the Single View and you can add CSS here which is for the listview or the Multiple do you use plural and then it'll be Placed in his prospective places the same goes with a JavaScript accept that you have for me Places to Target instead of just one if remember we when we looked at the way that we are The building the JavaScript there is a file a JavaScript file which just has JavaScript For the view and then there is the footer area which is under the HTML and PHP At the end of the file there is a whole area which is just JavaScript at the footer of the file And so we decided to add the option of adding JavaScript to the file Or JavaScript to the footer after view or the file or Siri the view file or the view Views file or their views footer so it just gives you the option of tar You now listen this script can run is a function and I just wanted to be able to be on the page Then you add it to the file and then if you wanna use the function you can add it to the footer that Ok then there is a PHP area and here you have the option of adding Adding JavaScript to your editing View Primarily so if we look at editing views the moment you click on Add JavaScript it opens at tab and now the way that we implement Jarvis The way that we wanna implement Ajax is Primary Via the controller and method implementation So if I explain that to you the component has a controller called Ajax JS PHP you can open their and there Then it has a model But we just called Ajax ok so you have a controller and you have a model now no prompt roller is Like the gatekeeper he first does a few checks and balances to ensure that the data is Correct that that the token is right that if you have sent this to be Validating whether he is a user then it also checks that there's a user ID If you have said it that it doesn't require them to be a user it basically would drop off this validation I will show you that What's this is you so that you can sorry But you can follow me there is a controller area and then there's some odd model area and the model is Basically a place where you can write a a method Which is queried from the controller so you can see in the controller it basically is getting the Ajax model and then it is querying a method in that model called Dropbox so here We are the Dropbox method and it's getting the view Name there it seems that I'm I'm not even really using it just make sure the moment I'm not in Even using this variable but it's none the less it is here and I possibly will use it later It becomes necessary so I'm basically just activating this method to run And when this method runs it Triggers some Global methods to run and On the return of that value it Triggers another local method so again I'm not Trying to teach you PHP here all I want to show us that this part after The code was custom written so if we go back to our component you'd see that there is that code So when you click on Ajax you add that name Basically writing a method make sure that it's set to public and your right your Two method in here and in the in a tax input you would say ok listen that Task name is check Dropbox this thing than you so I want to pass it is view and Type and both of them are integers and it Needs to run the view needs to run a Dropbox method And it type needs to run an update draw box and both of them should check with it So only users get fire these back and methods and the You can see that you have gone Obviously there Filters are The same as with Any field Did you can select And so into chair here would be fine and if there's no value you said no This task name Is what you be using in your JavaScript So I first wanted to show you the PSP side And then the ties name itself ok so let's just Make sure I The method name Disappear And that should correspond To the method That you set up in your Ajax method Hphs Which is possibly the method in which model did data get the data Structure the data and give it back to the Ajax call So you return the data Inside of this method But in your JavaScript you will be using the task name 2 To get Today System So if we go to the JavaScript JavaScript What it seems I used the JavaScript example which is gonna forget Way ahead of us But Since we started Let me not leave you and Matt there So I like I'll have to close out here And I'm going Quite a head of myself now but I need to otherwise you'll feel very lost In summer distributor Which is the component to which that view belongs There is a place called scripts And I have added a feature Which is called Chronic Global Events So I have added a feature To add Global events Now Global events or the way I Implementing at Is simply an event that should run every time A page Anytime anyplace in the system opens I wanted to run the global event Now the way I talk it it is I say load Dropbox Ajax Ok It's a It's a global event and it Needs to do that And The Drop Box Ajax Is basically Set up in the Helper class So I have a helper class Which is called load Dropbox Ajax and it gets the The takes the job document object adds a script declaration And here is the JavaScript That is adding And you see That in that it is using checkbox listing Asda Task So it's targeting The Ajax Controller And asking 4 check Dropbox listing As the task And it's passing through it A token And the view name So possibly where what like to use that View Idolator Dialogue from which area this automated Feature mostly gets Triggered I'm not doing that as yet So This is just what the script will do So there is something JQuery Which only fired after page has loaded And at the moment it's just adding a dummy 3 in there To just trigger the net And so That is really how this group in South on the page and I'm sorry that I used that as an example I realise it's A little bit Ahead of ourselves But Nonetheless I I want to Not leave it at a loose end So I Redoing it That is where this PHP Script really gonna be used So since I need to add this somewhere I just selected a view and that Advantages And I added the Ajax control the concepts here But the actual JavaScript that fires off all this Is set to the global Event and that means every time a bakkie in Area is opened In drop in this component It loads that JavaScript to the Vue And a JavaScript execute Ajax request which starts updating the Dropbox listing Now I'm not gonna explain all of that Dropbox listening to you now it's a Squat advance concept But it's basically Sermon distributor is able to link two Dropbox sermons Oh sorry Imedia inside of a shared Dropbox folder And this whole method here that be looking at Passes that Dropbox folder every so often To make sure that it's That's what it's all about So that is just looking at adding Ajax You can see that If you know The July API You know that it has a get item Method It has a get items method in the In the model So in the model there's a get item method In the editing model and in the list model there is a get items method Then there's a get list query in the Jay model list And there is a safe method There's a post safe method In the in the controller Is allowed at Edit method There's a batch copy method There's a batch move method there's a script before it it Sorry before delete Method There's a script After delete And these are all PHP places in which you can dump custom scripting So you wanna in the safe method Now Obviously again You need to know where the safe men It is so if I would open Sermon here Scroll down Ok so there's the get item So you can add custom script into the get item Scroll down There's the batch That's coffee Matchmove There is a safe method And so if we go back here and we click on the safe It says here That should run PHP year that should run in the safe method And then You have the data Voeten toere And it's called Data So If you look here It means You're able to Target that Value The gets placed into Save Ok And I am sure that your custom Value Code Will be placed in before the parents saved But if you do not If you do not know in any of those Custom scripts Where that code will be set What you can do Use type It is Loaded Here And in compile save it and compile the component and then go look at the code And you see where it is showing up And then you can add Ok I've got all these values already In the script Because all that component builder is gonna do it's just gonna die Let's say It will just say That's that's all It'll just add to string so when the component itself runs it will treated as code This is a comment but I mean if it was code You just execute So it is the way for you to add custom script Right into your car Almost anywhere really You are able to Target Through these switches The most safe hook Is actually in the controller not in the model So You got the car Troller Sermon Scroll to the bottom And you see there is a post save hook And it basically gives you the model and it gives you the valid data and you can Actually Form exstrophy But in all these things You you should just read Is the description here it's a speech be here that should run in the post safe work method And there's the object model is the data model Object and their Razor validator So if you just read our little note here Then you can start Kodi For it Ok That is so adding custom scripting To the view Basically the list view as well as the Each View And then the MySQL dump area Which we looked at earlier You can do two kinds of dumps now What is this used mostly for Well what I found while I was Busy developing That I would be Busy setting up a component Uninstall it and then add dummy data to it to see if it works And then every time I make a change And I uninstall that component and install the new one Because whatever changes made to the database Won't be You're not added to the database via an update You need to uninstall the component Again To get the database back And so Dude the only way I could do save myself Time Is there actually say listen I'm gonna Re-install this component and the dummy data for sermons I would like to retain And so I would go table Open the tables in all show me a list of all the Tables that are in the database at that moment And then I would scroll to sermon Cement table Tick on it An overload The theatre table and What it should be called In the data set Here is some explanation if you want to do Other tables so let's say you wanna Habit map to multiple tables then this is the explanation on health Do that I would not recommend doing this because possibly You will not get What do you expect And so Just going with the values that it populates for you Possibly your best call Unless those values change And if you aren't making changes adding new fields You must realise that you need to come and reset this by clicking on something else And then clicking on it again And then it loads the new View the new Sorry The new list Are Fields that are related to this table To this Back in view Table And that way When when you compile the components Main component of the we'll actually grabbed it data From the database and build a dump file for you Now that is one way of doing it I might be a little bit complex but it is saved Tons of hours The other way would be to just do a dump file itself So you'd go to Your Your MySQL Udo pinned it specific Use this thing Smaller Fuel types And you click on Export And then you would select A sequel format And click go And this will create a dump file Of all the data in the table And you can basically Paste that dump file in here Now I was looking at Important So you click export Pickwick Then seek world and go And then just save it Then Go to that file Open it And having it open You just replace This Stream Worth Hash Underscore So and then replace all And you will not use the table Structure because that is already in the database You just use This area Basically he would copy Area That Cut Come here Paste And clicksafe And that will mean that you have to dump file And it will always be at it To your new Install If a dump file is way too big You will see it by just after your pic safe come and look At the end And see if it cut it off somewhere So let's say Cut it off there then I know my father Too big for for unused Sure Structure For your dump File I use medium text All the medium Here Prosafe That's Sequel I used medium text So that means It's quite big You can really put a lot of Text inside of it You wanna know exactly how much just Google it Ok so I'm gonna remove this Ivy It's not related 27 all And In fact I'm not even good Ok That is basically setting up an admin View I know I've run around and it seems like A dick And I possibly will redo this video at a certain stage Try to be Structured But I think it is informative enough And View Have any questions please email me Hyundai Try to communicate with you And if I see that a certain question comes up I will add it to the Video Possibly redoing Specific Admin views Squad intense And we will possibly revisit many of the Concepts that we flew Thank you for watching
